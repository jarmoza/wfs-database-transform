The first section of text discusses gender transformations in the crossed offspring of Japanese gypsy moths and European moths, which can lead to what the article refers to as \"intersexes\" in 50 percent of the offspring. The article cites differences in genetic adaptations due to weather betweeen the two species as part of the cause of these gender transformations. The second text-based clipping discusses the effects of, respectively, increased doses and absences of thyroid on the development of tadpoles.

"Page_desc":"This page is black and white and features two large clippings from Zoo Magazine's Animals in Art series, both of which include several photographs of Chinese sculptures of animals. The bottom clipping has been folded on the right edge to make it fit into the scrapbook. Morgan has pasted small image-based clippings onto the two Zoo magazine clippings, including three clippings pasted to the back of the folded clipping. Other small text-based clippings are pasted on the scrapbook page and surround the two larger clippings. The clippings are arranged in a mix of both portrait and landscape page orientations. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a September 1957 clipping from Zoo magazine’s Animals in Art series titled \"The Old Chinese\", which features photographs of animals in Chinese art, including a plaque of a monkey's face, gilt-bronze beavers, a bronze deer, a painting of a giraffe, and a bronze half-plaque of a lion. The photographs of the art are attributed to |Mr. A. W. Bahr [63]| and are captioned as: “Bronze half-plaque of a lion—probably about 2,000 years old”; “Plaque of a Monkey’s face—probably Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-906)”; “Gilt-bronze beavers, from seven to eleven hundred years old”; “Bronze deer, perhaps contemporary with the monkey plaque above”; and “Painting of a giraffe. How had the Chinese heard of giraffes 1,000 years ago?” %\r\n- an August 1936 clipping from Zoo magazine’s Animals in Art series titled \"3- The Old Chinese\". The clipping has a small write-up, which reads: \"For many hundreds of years, under dynasty after dynasty, Chinese artists have produced some of the finest animal art the world has ever seen. The recent Chinese art exhibition in London combined many wonderful specimens. The artists were not restricted to any particular style, but ranged in all mediums from the realistically life-like to very formal, stylized designs\". The clipping features a photograph of a pottery dog, captioned as “Right: Spirited rendering of a dog in pottery. Wei dynasty, 1,700 years ago”, and a photograph of an owl, captioned as “Left: a bronze wine vessel in the form of an owl. Chou dynasty, 3,000 years ago\". The right side of the lower clipping has been folded over to fit the scrapbook page, and Morgan has pasted three small black and white clippings onto the back of the fold. %\r\n- a verse from |Walt Whitman's [242]| \"There was a Child went Forth\" that reads: \"There was a child went forth every day, / And the first object he look'd upon, that object he / became,/ And that object became part of him for the day or / a certain part of the day. / Or for many years or stretching cycles of years\" %\r\n- a clipping from |Christopher Marlowe's [240]| Doctor Faustus, which reads: \"Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,/ And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,/ Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,/ In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?\" %\r\n- lines from |William Dunbar's [239]| Scots poem \"The Dance\", which read: \"Mony sweir bumbard belly huddron\" %\r\n- lines from |Dylan Thomas's [136]| \"The Mouse and the Woman\" reading: \"One day I may have no limbs to walk with, no hands to touch with. No heart under my breast\" %\r\n- a line from |George Chapman [241]| and Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander, which reads: \"Joy graven in sense, like snow in water, wasts\" %\r\n- lines from |Thomas Kyd's [20]| The Spanish Tragedy, which read: \"You have oft, for these two lips,/ Neglected cassia, or the natural sweets/ Of the spring-violet: they are not yet much wither'd\" %\r\n- lines from Dylan Thomas's \"A Saint About to Fall\", which read: \"Cry joy that this witchlike midwife second / Bullies into rough seas you so gentle/ And makes with a flick of the thumb and sun/ A thundering bullring of your silent and girl-circled/ island\" %\r\n- three separately clipped text-based clippings are arranged like the lines of a poem. The clippings are: a line from a German hymn reading \"Wir weren all verloren\", a line from |John Webster's [243]| The Duchess of Malfi reading \"a face folded in sorrow\", and a line reading \"the usual cafuffle\" %\r\n- pink and blue ink doodles drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a medallion, which is pasted onto the upper right corner of the 1957 \"The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of the exterior of a house, which overlaps with the upper left corner of the 1937 \"The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a porcelain figurine pasted onto the 1936 \"3-The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a painting showing a woman riding a horse sidesaddle, which has been pasted onto the 1936 \"3-The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a medallion, which has been pasted onto the 1936 \"3-The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a photograph of a marble statue of a human figure in a courtyard, which has been pasted on to the back of the fold of the 1936 \"3-The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a metallic basket, which has been pasted on to the back of the fold of the 1936 \"3-The Old Chinese\" clipping described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a porcelain figurine of woman in a gown.

The clipping also includes a write-up about Dürer, stating that while his fame during his life “rested mostly on his large, pretentious works on religious subjects”, he is now “recognized to have been also a supreme artist in depicting nature, whose commonest forms he endowed with a fresh and lovely significance.” The clipping also states that the drawings shown in the article were chosen “to show how Dürer pioneered in accurate observation of creatures which most people of his time would have scorned to notice at all”. %\r\n- lines from |Edgar Allan Poe's [87]| \"Israfel\", reading: \"If I could dwell/ Where Israfel/ Hath dwelt, and he where I,/ He might not sing so wildly well/ A mortal melody,/ While a bolder note that this might/ swell/ From my lyre within the sky\" %\r\n- lines from |John Donne's [77]| \"Of the Progresse of the Soule: The Second Anniversarie\", reading: \"Shee, shee is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this,/ What fragmentary rubbidge this world is/ Thou knowst, and that it is not worth a thought;/ He honors it too much that thinks it nought./ Thinke then, my soule, that death is but a Groome,/ Which brings a Taper to the outward roome\" %\r\n- lines from John Donne's \"The Undertaking\", reading: \"But he who lovelinesse within/ Hath found, all outward loathes,/ For he who colour loves, and skinne,/ Loves but their oldest clothes\" %\r\n- lines from |Henry Vaughan's [90]| \"The World\", reading: \"I saw Eternity the other night,/ Like a great Ring of pure and endless light,/ All calm, as it was bright;/ And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,/ Driven by the spheres/ Like a vast shadow moved; in which the world/ And all her train were hurled\" %\r\n- lines from |James Thomson's [92]| \"In the City of the Dreadful Night\", reading: \"The moving moon and stars from east to west/ Circle before her in the sea of air;/ Shadows and gleams glide round her solemn rest./ Her subjects often gaze up to her there:/ The strong to drink new strength of iron endurance,/ The weak new terrors; all, renewed assurance/ And confirmation of the old despair\" %\r\n- lines from |Percy Bysshe Shelley's [89]| \"A Defence of Poetry\", reading: \"great secret of morals is love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument of moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the cause\" %\r\n- lines from |Thea Gabriele von Harbou's [88]| Metropolis, reading: \"I have known those in the ecstasy of desire to have forced women down to them from the highest part of the shell's wall, that they, diving, like seagulls, without injuring a limb, while others have fallen to their death. That man there was no God, no Storm, no Fire, and his drunkenness most certainly inspired him with no desire. It seems to me that he has come up from hell and its roaring in the intoxication of damnation.

The clipping includes a brief writeup and two captioned photographs. The writeup reads: \"Before the Spaniards, led by |Pizarro [97]|, destroyed in the sixteenth century the ancient Peruvian empire of the Incas, a high level of artistic achievement was reached by the Indians, some of whom were expert potters. They modelled many animals, mythological and real, and among the real ones their two principal breeds of dog. Several specimens of the Chincha ‘bulldog’ in black Chimu-ware have been found in Northern Peru by a German expedition, from whose report these illustrations are reproduced”. The first photograph is captioned as: \"Close-up of the so-called Chincha bulldog modelled in black Chimu pottery and found at Trugillo in North Peru\". The second photograph is captioned as: \"A bitch and puppies modelled in pottery in the form of a whistle. The finger-holes are in the tops of the puppies' heads, and the contrivance produces high, piping notes\" %\r\n- lines from |Thomas Traherne's [93]| \"Amendment\", reading: \"That all things should be mine,/ This makes His bounty most divine./ But that they all more rich should be,/ And far more brightly shine,/ As used by me;/ It ravishes my soul to see the end,/ To which this work so wonderful doth tend\" %\r\n- lines from |Gerard Manley Hopkins's [99]| \"Heaven-Haven\", reading: \"I have desired to go/ Where springs not fail,/ To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail/ And a few lilies blow./ And I have asked to be/ Where no storms come,/ Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,/ And out of the swing of the sea\" %\r\n- lines from |Thomas Traherne's [93]| \"The Anticipation\", reading: \"His Essence is all Act: He did that He/ All Act might always be./ His nature burns like fire;/ His goodness infinitely does desire/ To be by all possess;/ His love makes others blest./ It is the glory of His high estate,/ And that which I for evermore admire,/ He is an Act that doth communicate\" %\r\n- lines from Thomas Traherne's \"My Spirit\", reading: \"O wondrous Self! O sphere of light,/ O sphere of joy most fair;/ O act, O power infinite;/ O subtile and unbounded air!/ O living orb of sight!/ Thou which within me art, yet me!

The first clipping reads: \"|Professor Allen [98]|, an American naturalist, says that human beings can hear only a fragment of the full songs of bird. The wren has more than 113 notes, but we hear five. And we can distinguish only a fraction of the thirty-five notes the sparrow utters at the rate of seventeen a second\". The second clipping reads: \"Incidentally, it may be possible after extensive research to record and transpose to a much lower vibration the songs of birds which most people have never yet heard. Yellowhammers begin at a frequency of five thousand five hundred, and the grasshopper warbler soars to a frequency of eight thousand. Perhaps this is why the bird has been named 'grasshopper,' for the grasshopper itself makes a noise which no human being has ever properly heard. And when we realize that some tropical birds begin to sing at a frequency of twenty thousand, the excitement of discovering new worlds of song and sound can well be imagined\".",

"Page_desc":"This page is comprised of black and white clippings and features two large illustrated article clippings, one from Zoo magazine's Animals in Art series titled “Persian & Indian” and one from Country Life titled “A Guernsey Idol”. Smaller clippings, mostly text-based, surround these two larger clippings on the left and right sides. The large clippings in the center of the page are arranged in the portrait page orientation, while the small framing clippings are arranged in the landscape page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- an illustrated clipping from Zoo magazine's Animals in Art series dated September 1936 and titled “4.—Persian & Indian”. The clipping includes a brief writeup and two photographs of paintings. The writeup reads: \"Both the Persian and Indian artists had this in common—that they saw animals as beautiful pieces of design, to be incorporated in larger designs by a man’s organising brain. Now it is not easy to see the essential form of an animal and the essential rhythm of its movements. It is much easier to make a clumsy but superficially realistic picture which is not really worth looking at. It is because they understand the shapes of animals and wove them into delightful patterns that the Persians and Indians were such good animal artists”. The first image is captioned as: \"A Persian painting 300 years old, now in the British Museum. It is a piece of pure rhythmic composition, each galloping horse having its own rhythm and all their rhythms linking together\". The second image is captioned as: \"An Indian painting of the Rajput school which shows water-buffaloes fighting. The clever composition stresses the powers of force and weight in conflict\" %\r\n- a clipping from a 1938 Country Life article by |F. B. Dell [937]| titled \"A Guernsey Idol\", which includes a black and white photograph of a stone female figure that is currently a gatepost at St Martin's Church. The article speculates that the figure was an idol and was buried at St Martin's Church in Guernsey as a way to prevent people from worshipping it. The article also states that \"not that many years ago\" a churchwarden attempted to break the idol up. It was saved, but not before being broken in half. It has now been cemented back together. %\r\n- lines from |Edward Lear's [29]| \"The Jumblies\", reading: \"Far and few, far and few,/ Are the lands where the Jumblies live;/ Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,/ And they went to sea in a sieve\" %\r\n- lines from Edward Lear's \"The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo\", reading: \"On the Coast of Coromandel/ Where the early pumpkins blow,/ In the middle of the woods/ Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò\" %\r\n- lines from |William Bell Scott's [101]| \"The Witch's Ballad\", reading: \"Each one in her wame shall hide/ Her hairy mouse, her wary mouse,/ Fed on madwort and agramie,/ Wear amber beads between her breasts,/ And blind-worm's skin about her knee\" %\r\n- lines from the |anonymous [6]| \"The Elfin Knight\", reading: \"Say, can you plough me an acre of land,/ Sing Ivy Leaf, Sweet William and Thyme,/ Between the sea and the salt sea strand,/ And you shall be a true lover of mine\" %\r\n- lines from |Percy Bysshe Shelley's [89]| \"Adonais\", reading: \"Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream\" %\r\n- Latin lines from |Gaius Valerius Catullus's [103]| \"Poem 63\", reading: \"dea, magna dea, Cybelle, dea, domina, Dindimei, procul a mea tuos sit furor omnis, hera, domo: alios age incitatos, alios age rabidos\" %\r\n- lines from |T.S.

The second clipping reads: \"That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,/ That Beauty in which all things work and move,/ That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse/ Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love/ Which through the web of being blindly wove/ By man and beast and earth and art and sea,/ Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of/ The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,/ Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality\" %\r\n- lines from |Gerard Manley Hopkins' [99]| \"Thou art indeed just, Lord, if I contend\", reading: \"Wert thou my enemy, O thou my friend,/ How wouldst thou worse, I wonder, than thou dost/ Defeat, thwart me?

"Page_desc":"This page is predominantly black and white, except for one small colour drawing, likely inspired by or reproducing a glyph from pre-Columbian pictorial manuscript. This page features a black and white reproduction of da Vinci’s Heads of Sts Thomas and James the Greater, a black and white reproduction of Giovanni’s etching “View of a Town with the Bishop’s Tomb, from the Verdute”, a black and white photograph of a sculpted mule on a chariot fitting, and a clipping from the Observer titled \"The Ladybird in Folklore\". The Observer clipping has been folded on its bottom edge to fit into the scrapbook. Smaller image-based and text-based clippings surround these four larger clippings. The clippings are arranged in a mix of landscape and portrait page orientations. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large newspaper clipping from the Observer titled \"The Ladybird in Folklore\" and dated 25 September 1938. The article discusses |Sir Jacob Grimm's [145]| theory that the legends surrounding ladybirds and goldbeetles are \"relics of prehistoric beetle-worship\", linking these beetles to the |Virgin Mary [41]| and, before her, |Freya [146]|, Northern goddess of Spring and Love. The clipping quotes the English children’s rhyme “Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home! Your house is on fire and your children will burn!”. The clipping compares this English version with the Scottish variant, quoted as: “King, King Gollowa’, Up your wings and fly awa’: Over land and over sea, Tell me where my love can be? (Kincardineshire)”.  The clipping discusses traditions around Europe connected to the ladybird, such as the Swedish belief that when a ladybird lands on a girl’s hand, the direction she flies denotes “whence comes the bridegroom”. In Switzerland, ladybirds are offered “milk, bread, and a silver spoon”, and in Germany, a ladybird on someone’s finger is asked “How long shall I live?—one year, two years” until the ladybird flies to its home “in heaven” or “in the sun”. The article then describes how the scarabaeus was an “emblem of eternal life, self-generation, resurrection, and of the sun” in ancient Egypt, and describes |Khefera [962]|, an Egyptian beetle-god. In India, the Sanskrit name for ladybird was “Indragôpa (cowherd of Indra, Sun and Thunder-god)”. The bottom of the ladybird clipping has been folded up to make it fit the scrapbook page. %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Leonardo da Vinci's [137]| Heads of Sts |Thomas [141]| and |James the Greater [142]| %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a sculpture of a horse or mule on a rein-ring and captioned as: \"A Sumptuous Sumerian Chariot Fitting: A silver and electrum rein-ring from |Queen Shub-Ad's [144]| chariot pole; dating from 3200 B.C. - found by |Sir Leonard Woolley [143]| in the Royal Graves at Ur and now in the British Museum. (Height: 5 1/4 In.)\".

Jansky says that he will \"construct the most powerful shortwave receiver in the world, so that he can study these signals more closely,\" and reminds cynics that extraterrestrial communication is possible, given that \"our more powerful military short-wave transmitters send signals that could be received in the moon if anyone happened to be there\".

It describes |Sir Joseph Barcroft's [185]| efforts to explore the \"borderland of insanity by chilling his body to the early stages of freezing\" in order to \"pass beyond the 'censorship of the mind’\". He says he chilled himself to the degree that \"nerve censorship\" let go, and he found that \"he had no natural apprehension lest some person alien to the experiment should enter the room and find him unclad\".

The other is captioned as: \"somewhat resembling, in shape, a modern teapot, with a particularly long spout: A vessel made of yellow clay found in a grave in Necropolis B, and decorated in the same style as that seen in the adjoining illustration\". The second clipping shows three objects, one a pot \"decorated with fabulous animals, horned and winged, a painted 'collar' round the spout, and geometrical designs: A vase from Necropolis B in yellowish terra-cotta\", one \"a small bronze harness bell\", and one \"a pendant ornament in repoussé silver: An example of delicate metal-work, with a cross-shaped design, from Necropolis B\" %\r\n- two separate clippings from |Samuel Taylor Coleridge's [187]| \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The first clipping reads: \"He prayeth well, who loveth well/ Both man and bird and beast./ He prayeth best, who loveth best/ All things both great and small;/ For the dear God who loveth us,/ He made and loveth all\". The second clipping reads: \"The harbor-bay was clear as glass,/ So smoothly it was strewn!/ And on the bay the moonlight lay,/ And the shadow of the moon\" %\r\n- a clipping from |John Milton's [2]| Paradise Lost, reading: \"From Morn/ To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,/ A Summers day; and with the setting Sun/ Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,/ On Lemnos th' Aegoean Ile\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph from Prediction magazine in November 1936, captioned as: \"Below, a remarkable photograph of |Eleanora Zugun [186]|, showing the stigmatic phenomena taking place on her face.

The clippings are arranged in a mix of landscape and portrait page orientations. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a newspaper article from the Bulletin dated 17 October 1936 and titled \"Largest Human Brain on Record\". The article describes a skull that is believed to have \"belonged to an Aleut who lived hundreds of years ago.\" The article argues that he \"had a brain capacity of 2005 cubic centimetres\", as well as stating that the \"average man has a brain capacity of about 1450 cubic centimetres, and the average woman 1300\", leading |Dr. Hrdlicka [191]| to believe \"that the skull's owner was probably one of the cleverest men of his day and age\" %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from the Bulletin dated 12 February 1937, which shows a photograph of a large carved ear with hieroglyphics carved around it.

What a man thinks, that he is; this is the old secret\" %\r\n- two clippings from an article with the subtitles of \"Fruit with a Poisonous Breath\" and \"If Apples Breathed More Slowly\". The clippings describe the work of two unnamed South African scientists who grew sprouts in \"a box through which blew air that had passed over rows of ripe peaches\". The sprouts shriveled within a week. Plums were found to have the same effect. The scientists discovered that \"ethylene is the culprit\" and are now exploring if ethylene could be \"used for stopping fruit from ripening too soon,\" meaning \"fresher and better fruit from beyond the seas\". The second part of the article discusses work by unnamed scientists in England who are working on slowing the rotting of apples by slowing their \"breathing\". They do so by keeping the apples in \"an atmosphere containing small portions of various gases.\" %\r\n- pink and blue ink doodles drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]|, including two star-shaped doodles that frame the clipping of the starfish described below %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a large arched church doorway %\r\n- a long black and white photograph that appears to show a detail of a stone carving %\r\n- a colour photograph of a red, yellow, blue and green bird with the caption \"Wilson's Bird of Paradise\", likely from a cigarette card %\r\n- a colour photograph of a red, green, and yellow beetle %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a body of water surrounded by hills %\r\n- a colour photograph of a red and white starfish %\r\n- two small separately clipped black and white decorative photographs that show details of stone carvings, one depicting figures on horseback %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a church with many spiked spires %\r\n- a small handwritten clipping reading: \"Gudbyrne scan/ Heard hondlocen, hringīren scīr/ Song in searwun, dā hīe sele furdum/ In hyra gryregeatwum gangan cwōmon\".",

"Page_desc":"This page is primarily comprised of black and white clippings, except for two colour drawings of small characters, inspired by or reproducing figures from pre-Columbian pictorial manuscript, and a colour drawing of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, captioned as a \"Greater Weever-Fish\". Other clippings on this page include a large article excerpt discussing the tradition of wood-carving among the Yoruba people, a black and white photograph of a carving by Bamgboye, a large clipping that shows three sections of a wall-plaque by Bamgboye, and a black and white reproduction of Gromaire's \"Le faucheur flamand\". Smaller image-based and text-based clippings are also included on this page. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large clipping discussing the tradition of wood-carving \"among the Igbomina and Ekiti sub-tribes of the Yoruba people\". The article states that the traditional forms of wood-carving have survived “longer in those parts of Yorubaland by reason of their seclusion from the influence of Mohammedan priest and Christian missionary, both of whom have frowned upon the old craft because of its intimate connection with paganism”. The article says the craft is in \"danger of dying out completely\", however, due to an opening up of the country and devaluing of African art at home. The article then takes a patronizing turn. It states: “The old religious ideas are passing away and the African has not yet realized that his own art is a far more worthy decoration of his churches and other buildings that the tawdry imitations of European furniture which he buys. Forestry regulations are also said to have had an effect of discouraging the few carvers who might still have carried their trade”. The article then discusses |Bamgboye [193]|, who is said to be \"one of the best of the surviving Yoruba carvers\" and whose work is on exhibit at the Empire Exhibition. The article continues its patronizing stance, describing his carving as “remarkable for its technical efficiency; in contrast with so much carelessly executed carpentry in modern Africa, his work stands out by its clean finish. A rasp is the favorite tool of the native carpenter; sandpaper and putty his indispensable materials. Bamgboye will have none of such things; a sharp adze, a sharp knife and a few chisels are his only tools”. The article continues: “On the other hand, his art is strictly conventional. Like many other African carvers, he works to a formula. To carve a head is a matter of following certain rules; you begin in a certain way and proceed from cut to cut in a prescribed order; and the result is almost always the same, a face with an air of serene dignity but completely lacking in individuality. Bamgboye cannot carve a portrait. Even the decorative figures which he carves on stools and trays are conventionalized representations of cowries, birds’ eyes, sandals and so on. He finds difficulty in breaking away from such stereotyped subjects to depict scenes from life on a panel. At the same time he enjoys such experiments and appreciates the results”. Places named in the clipping: Northern Ondo, Oyo, Ilorin Province, Yorubaland, and Africa. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a carving, captioned as: \"A dignified iroko carving representing the head of a Yoruba woman\", to which  Morgan has added a note reading: \"by Bamgboye\" %\r\n- a large clipping that shows three black and white photographs of a wall-plaque by Bamgboye. The first image shows the entire wall-plaque and is captioned as: \"carved on a mahogany plank about four feet long. The scenes from right to left represent the birth, life and death of a hunter. Two of the panels are illustrated on a larger scale below\". The second photograph shows the center panel, which is captioned as: \"Enjoying life: the village chief wearing necklaces and holding fly whisk with musicians and friends\". The third photograph shows the left panel, described as: \"Death: the wives are mourning and friends are firing dane guns. The body, wrapped in a cloth, is lying on a mat. Above it are some of the dead man's possessions: a hoe, matchet, axe, pocket knife, pipe, carved stool and waist band\" %\r\n- four lines from |Jean Racine's [148]| Phèdre, reading: \"Il a vu le Cocyte et les rivages sombres,/ Et s'est montré vivant aux infernales ombres;/ Mais qu'il n'a pu sortir de ce triste sèjour,/ Et repasser les bords qu'on passe sans retour\" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Marcel Gromaire's [189]| painting \"Le faucheur flamand\", depicting a Flemish man hammering out a sickle %\r\n- pink and blue ink doodles drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]|, including small drawings that resemble seaweed and bubbles that Morgan has placed around the image of the Yoruba woman carving described above %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- two separate colour images of drawn characters, likely inspired by or reproduced from pre-Columbian pictorial manuscript %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a male porcelain figurine holding a cup in one hand and a pitcher in another %\r\n- a black and white photograph of an arched and carved stone frieze showing many figures %\r\n- a colour drawing of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, captioned as a \"Greater Weever-Fish\" %\r\n- two black and white photographs that are difficult to make out, although the second photograph may be of a carving of some sort.

The top two-thirds of this page feature a large clipping from Chambers’s Journal titled “Marvellous Memories”. Small black and white image-based clippings frame this clipping on the left and right sides. The lower third of the page includes five more image-based clippings, including the Bondone painting. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a clipping from Chambers's Journal dated February 1936 and titled \"Marvellous Memories\" by |Richard Culham [198]|. The clipping details great feats of memory by famous figures in the past. Feats recounted include those of |Joseph Justus Scaliger [202]|, who as a boy “learned each day one hundred lines of Latin verse dictated to him, and later performed what is probably the most amazing memory feat of all time. He memorized the whole of Homer in twenty-one days.” |Mozart [205]| is also described and is said to have “visited the Sistine Chapel to hear a special performance of |Allegri’s [213]| famous ‘Miserere,’ written for two choirs of nine voices. After the single hearing, he returned to his lodgings and wrote down the whole of the score of the composition from memory.”  The clipping argues that: \"In these days of reference books and artificial memory aids, there is a tendency for the art and practice of memory to be neglected\", and thus for the faculty of memory to become \"atrophied in this restless age\". People named in the clipping: |Bernard Zufall [197]|, |Pyrrhus [199]|, |Cineas [200]|, |Giovanni Pico della Mirandola [201]|, |Joseph Justus Scaliger [202]|, |Antonio di Marco Magliabechi [203]|, |Morton [206]|, |Daniel Schenkel [204]|, |Claudius Menetrier [212]|, |Daguessau [207]|, |Boileau [208]|, |Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [205]|, and |Gregorio Allegri [213]|.

The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large colour photograph of an eclipse attributed to |Irvine C. Gardner [210]| in the February 1937 National Geographic. The image is captioned as: \"In the first natural colour photograph of an eclipse ever reproduced, the corona flares into view as the moon blots out the sun\". Below the caption a short write-up reads: \"Normally invisible because of the sun's greater brilliance, the corona's blazing gaseous mass is always present, but cannot be seen except during a total eclipse. The most striking feature of this photograph is that the sun's chromosphere (a layer of incandescent gas whose lower left-hand edge is not yet eclipsed) and the bright prominences rising from around the sun, appear blueish-white instead of red, as heretofore depicted. The notches in the moon's rim are not real, but are caused by the light spreading from the prominences. This one-second exposure was made by the National Geographic Society-National Bureau of Standards Expedition on June 19, 1936, at Ak Bulak, U.S.S.R\" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Paul Signac's [211]| 1907 La Baie painting %\r\n- blue and pink ink doodles drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a medallion shaped like a sun with a face %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a painting that shows several emaciated figures in a line, possibly in a depiction of hell %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man who appears to standing inside of something large that obscures his lower body.

The article states that many \"old graves when opened are found to contain tiny glass or earthenware vessels known as tear-bottles\", which would have been filled with mourners' tears and \"laid beside the corpse as 'soul-substance'\". The article includes a drawing of two tear-bottles, underneath which is quoted Psalms 56-8: \"Put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a clipping describing how |Malcolm McDonald [252]| and |McKinnan [253]| killed the last Auk to be seen in Britain. The clipping reads: \"They found the bird on the ledge of a rock; they caught it asleep, tied its legs together, took it up to their bothy, kept it alive for three days, and then killed it with a stick, thinking it might be a witch. They threw the body behind the bothy and left it there. It was |Malcom McDonald [252]| who actually laid hold of the bird, and held it by the neck with his two hands, till the others came up and tied its legs. It used to make a great noise, like that made by a gannet, but much louder, when shutting its mouth. It opened its mouth when anyone came near it. It nearly cut the rope with its bill. A storm arose, and that, together with the size of the bird and the noise it made, caused them to think it was a witch. It was killed on the third day after it was caught, and |McKinnan [253]| declares they were beating it for an hour with two large stones before it was dead\".

This page features separate clippings of black and white photographs of bronze heads found in Ife. Also included on this page are two text-based clippings, one discussing the cosmic rays that hit the earth and the other from Picture Post, which discusses a large telescope that has been used to photograph Jupiter. All of the clippings except the prawn clipping are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of three bronze heads, captioned as: \"Three of the bronze heads excavated this year at Ife.

These photographs have enabled the discovery of two new moons, bringing the known total to 11 at that time. The article then states that when |Galileo Galilei [255]| first posited that Jupiter had four moons \"Certain important Cardinals had no difficulty in proving that Galileo must be wrong. A dignitary named |Sizzi [253]| roundly said, 'The moons are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore can have no influence on the earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore do not exist!'\".

The article emphasizes the importance of procreation to the continuance of life, and states that \"Our atmosphere is a futile shield against the terrific power of cosmic particles.

It was found in 1798 by a French officer of artillery named |Boussard [261]| among the ruins of Fort Saint Julien, near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile, and was removed, in 1799, to the Institut National at Cairo, to be examined by the learned; and |Napoleon [262]| ordered the inscription to be engraved and copies of it to be submitted to the scholars and learned societies of Europe. In 1801 it passed into the possession of the British, and it was sent to England in February 1802. It was exhibited for a few months in the rooms of the Society of Antiquaries, and then was finally deposited in the British Museum. From this inscription was first obtained the key to the decipherment of the hieroglyphics and the interpretation of the ancient language of Egypt; the names of the Kings, which in the hieroglyphics are enclosed within oblong rings or 'cartouches,' giving the clue to the identification of the letters of the hieroglyphic alphabet\" %\r\n- lines from |Gerard Manley Hopkins's [99]| \"The Woodlark\", reading: \"The blood-gush blade-gash/ Flame-rash rudred/ Bud shelling or broad-shed/ Tatter-tassel-tangled and dingle-a-dangled/ Dandy-hung dainty head\" %\r\n- lines from |John Milton's [2]| Paradise Lost, reading: \"Not that faire field/ Of enna, where Proserpin gathering flours/ Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis/ Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain/ To seek her through the world\" %\r\n- lines from |Percy Bysshe Shelley's [89]| \"Alastor\", reading: \"when some surprising Spirit,/ Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves/ Those who remain behind, not sobs or groans,/ The passionate tumult of a clinging hope;/ But pale despair and cold tranquillity,/ Nature's vast frame, the web of human things,/ Birth and the grave, that are not as they were\" %\r\n- lines from the Latin poem \"In Nuptias Iuniae et Mallii\" by |Gaius Valerius Catullus [103]|, reading: \"Collis o Heliconiei/ cultor, Vraniae genus,/ qui rapis teneram ad uirum/ Virginem, O Hymenaee Hymen,/ Hymen O Hymenaee;/ Cinge tempora floribus/ suaue olentis amaraci,/ flammeum cape laetus, huc/ Huc ueni, niueo gerens/ luteum pede soccum./ Excitusque hilari die,/ nuptialia concinens/ uoce carmina tinnula,/ Pelle humum pedibus, manu/ pineam quate taedam\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large black and white photograph of several crooked tombstones in a graveyard %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a lily and lily pads %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a decorative stone relief carving %\r\n- a handwritten clipping reading: \"The great men sayis that their distress/ Comis for the people's wickedness;/ The people sayis for the transgressioun/ Of great men, and their oppressioun:/ Bot mane will their awin sin confess\" %\r\n- a colour photograph of a bright red starfish %\r\n- three separate black and white photographs of clock faces, one showing the time 10:52, one showing 2:48, and one showing 10:20 %\r\n- a text-based clipping in a Cyrillic alphabet.",

None of the women are looking at the camera. The captions read: “Papua. A debutante of the Motuan tribe wears a tiara of leaves and flowers”; “N.E. Congo. Her beauty treatment started in infancy, when her mother bound her skull in tightly”; “Cameroons. Favourite style here is the bob of tightly plaited ringlets falling to the shoulders”; “Equator. A triumph of hairdressing to suit the shape of head—from Equatorial Africa”; “North Kenya. Close-shaven head and a fringe of twisted hair-tassels decked with beads”; “Congo. Another ‘long-head’ coiffure—the skull, crowned with a trumpet knot of hair”. The women are not named. The outside edge of this clipping has been folded to make it fit into the scrapbook. %\r\n- the final stanza of |François Villon's [266]| \"Les Regrets de la Belle Heaulmiere\" reading: \"Ainsi le bon temps regretons/ Entre nous, povres vielles sottes./ Assises bas, a crouppetons,/ Tout en ung tas comme pelottes,/ A petit feu de chenevottes/ Tost allumees, tost estaintes;/ Et jadis fusmes si mignottes!.../ Ainsi en prent a mains et maintes\" %\r\n- a stanza from |William Dunbar's [239]| The Tua Mariit Wemen and the Wedo, reading: \"Silver shouris doun shook, as the sheen crystal,/ And birds shouted in shaw, with their schill/ notis;/ The golden glitter and gleam so gladit their/ heartis,/ They made a glorious glee amang the green/ bewis./ The soft souch of the swyr,/ and soun of the/ streamis,/ The sweet savour of the sward, and singing of/ foulis/ Micht confort ony creature of the kin of |Adam [504]|\" %\r\n- a handwritten clipping that writes out a Scottish witch's chant, which reads: \"I knok this rag upone this stane / To raise the wind in the |divellis [936]| name / It sall not lye till I please againe\" %\r\n- a colour drawing of a Dragonet flying fish from a cigarette card, with the caption \"Player's Cigarettes\" and \"Dragonet\" printed on the clipping %\r\n- near the cigarette card clipping of the Dragonet described above, |Edwin Morgan [1]| has drawn on the scrapbook page several small bubbles in blue ink and a small, cartoonish Dragonet in pink ink %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a tree that appears to be in bud, which has been pasted on to the back of the fold of the large clipping showing the six women described above %\r\n- a black and white aerial photograph that seems to depict a rift in the earth, or possibly a mountain range, in the winter.

"Page_desc":"This page is black and white and is comprised of a mix of image-based and text-based clippings. It features an excerpt from a Picture Post article that extends over two clippings and discusses the experience of a girl who was blind and had her sight restored at the age of 22. Other clippings on the page include a photograph of two stone figures that appear to be sitting together in a vessel, a photograph of a sculpture of a shirtless man standing with his arms extended out to the side and raised at his elbows, and a photograph of a carved head. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- an excerpt from a Picture Post article dated 15 October 1938 that extends over two clippings. There are two sections to the included excerpts, one titled \"Sudden Sight - and Sorrow\" and the other \"All Faces Look Alike\". The article opens by stating that \"A blind girl of 22, it has just been reported by a leading eye-specialist, has recovered her sight. She is only the fifth case recorded in modern times, and what makes her case interesting to many more than doctors is the fact that, having been educated in the world of night, she has suddenly had to adapt herself to the new world which her opened eyes are revealing. She had been fully educated as a blind girl, and was a good Braille scholar. She had learned to read through her finger tips, and had gained a wide knowledge of history, geography, music and arithmetic before she ever saw anything at all. The first things that she recognized were a nurse's white apron, and a red dress; and then a window and a door. As her eyes blinked at these familiar things one after another, her mind bit by bit groped its way until she was able to fit the visions to the descriptions she had read in Braille. General outlines came first, and it was only afterwards that she was able to fit in the details. Thus, she looked down and saw for the first time her hands and fingers, but not at once her nails. Although she was able after a little thought to say, 'That is a chair, and that is a table,' of course she had to be told the names of colours. Red came first, and next green. All her life she had felt her way successfully up and down stairs; but when eyesight was added to her, she began to stumble on stairs that were not there. When she trusted to groping hands she never bumped into a door. But at first when she guided herself by sight, unable to judge distances, she was always having little accidents.\" The article continues, saying that distinguishing shapes was a challenge, and that some things disappointed her, such as the animals at the zoo, which she had thought would be bigger. She also had difficulty distinguishing faces at first, and generally found faces to be less happy looking than she imagined. Some of these disappointments brought about an initial depression in her. The article excerpt ends by stating: \"that is the doctor's story of the first months after the restoration of her sight. Even now when she wants to feel really happy she sits down, closes her eyes, and read a book in Braille\" %\r\n- the first several lines from the poem \"Song to the Wind\", which appears in the Book of |Taliesin [273]|, reading: \"Discover thou what is/ The strong creature from before the flood,/ Without flesh, without bone,/ Without vein, without blood,/ Without head, without feet,/ It will neither be older nor younger/ Than at the beginning;/ For fear of a denial,/ There are no rude wants/ With creatures./ Great God! how the sea whitens/ When first it comes!/ Great are its gusts/ When it comes from the south;/ Great are its evaporations/ When it strikes on coasts./ It is in the field, it is in the wood,/ Without hand, and without foot,/ Without signs of old age,/ Though it be co-aeval/ With the five ages or periods\" %\r\n- pink and blue ink spiral drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph that appears to show light reflecting on water %\r\n- a black and white image that is difficult to make out, but may be depicting water %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two stone figures that appear to be sitting together in a vessel of some sort, possibly a boat %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a male sculpture standing with his arms extended out to the side and raised at his elbows %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a carved head, possibly a mask %\r\n- a clipping with two black and white photographs of stone relief sculptures, one a detailed dragon's head and one that appears to depict a mermaid on the bow of a boat, jointly captioned as: \"Examples of Makara and Khmer sculpture recently excavated and now included among the pieces for exhibition in the new galleries of the Musée Guinet, Paris\".",

The photographs are credited to the U. S. Air Force. The write-up reads: A force equal to the power of 5 million tons of TNT raised the deadly cloud (above) that spread over Eniwetok, Nov. 1 1952. First of the H-bomb explosions, it was over 100 times more powerful than the A-Bomb set off in the Marshall Islands the year before, and 250 times more powerful than the A-bomb that killed some 80,000 human beings in Hiroshima, Aug. 5, 1945, and leveled an area larger than that of Newport News, Va. Since the 1952 bomb, two other American H-bombs have been tested, on March 1 and March 26 of this year. The force of the March 1 blast equaled that of 12 to 14 million tons of TNT. Some time this month the U.S. will set off another hydrogen blast.

These serious offences refer to homosexual acts, as well as charges to “incite |John Reynolds [303]| and |Edward McNally [304]| to commit serious offences with male persons”.

The article concludes by reporting that: “Some 25 minutes after the hearing concluded Lord Montagu was driven rapidly away from the police station in a high-powered low-built grey sports car. Wildeblood left the building shielding his face with a large trilby hat and ran to a chauffeur-driven car. The court was held in an upstairs room of the police station. About two dozen Pressmen were present and a few local residents. THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN—A FAIR HAIRED GIRL IN HER EARLY TWENTIES. Lord Montagu was in bed at his country mansion.

Morgan has annotated the clipping as as being from 1954. Below the photograph is a write-up, stating: “A series of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in March and April inaugurated the organ, above, which now occupies the whole of the rear wall of the auditorium and completes the scheme of interior decoration. The screen which had previously closed off the organ chamber has been made to fold back, exposing to view the whole depth of the chamber. It is a bold innovation on the part of the LCC architects, since organs are usually concealed either behind a grille or behind an arrangement of dummy pipes. In the Festival Hall only the graduated rows of pipes in the centre front are dummies. They are designed to give coherence to the informal groups of real pipes which can be seen receding in depth behind, and are arranged according to musical requirements. Their sculptural effect is emphasized by the lighting, which throws the whole interior of the organ chamber into relief” %\n- the full text of |Marghanita Laski's [317]| poem \"Apology for My TV\", which Morgan has annotated as being from 1954 %\n- a short clipping quoting |Dr. Cook [318]|, who states that \"the sparkling advertising signs and streetlamps of London make starlings more mature sexually than starlings living in the country\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- an original colour photograph of a naked man who is standing with one leg raised at the knee.

"Page_desc":"A page with a mix of colour and black and white clippings which features a large colour clipping of a silk design. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large colour photograph of a silk design that depicts mountains, trees and a village. The image is captioned as: \"|Li Po [319]| Feasting in the Peach and Pear Orchard on a Spring Night. Based on a literary piece dealing with the same subject by Li Po (701-762 A.D.), the great poet of the Tang dynasty, this silk design pictures the gaiety of the feast. Made in the Chien Lung Period (1736-1795 A.D.) of the Ching dynasty. Size: 135.8 by 70.8 centimetres\" %\r\n- a small text-based clipping titled \"Boy Victim of 1945 A-Blast?\" from 14 February 1953 in the Bulletin, which discusses |Masao Kagawa [320]|, who survived the bombing of Hiroshima but later died of leukemia %\r\n- two Chinese postage stamps clipped together from the same envelope and bearing a Peking postage mark from 1958 %\r\n- a clipping from Doubt magazine titled \"'Safety' Glass\", which describes the phenomena of windshields and other glass breaking as if shot, although no bullets or other damage is ever found. The article speculates that the substances used to treat and toughen safety glass may be interacting with the vapours and radio-activity being introduced to the air by \"the Bomb Boys\". The clipping quotes the Toronto Telegram and Morgan has annotated the clipping as being from August 1954 %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a small original photograph of a naked man who is seated and hugging his knees to his chest with his head down %\r\n- a text-based clipping about silk-weaving likely from the same source as the Li Po photograph, described above. The clipping reads: “This type of silk-weaving starts with the warp threads being fastened to the loom, while the woof threads of different colours are woven in with a small shuttle and cut off as needed in the design. To bring out fine shading and gradations of colour by means of the thin silken threads is a very delicate art. In the finest fabrics, an area of eleven square centimeters may contain 140 warp threads, while the woof threads may number up to 360. In ancient times, artisans skilled in this sort of weaving used to take as long as a year or two to complete a piece of silk half a square metre in size. On these pages we reproduce examples of figured silk fabrics which are now preserved up in the Northeast Museum in Shenyang (Mukden)” %\r\n- a black and white cropped photograph of a man's forehead and hair %\r\n- a colour photograph of two men riding black horses in the water along a beach %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a silhouetted person riding a horse across a large bridge. The rider appears to have some sort of lance or other long object in their hand.",

"Page_desc":"A largely black and white page featuring several photographs and a large text-based newspaper clipping about the Lord Montagu trials. There is only colour clipping on the page, which is pasted in the lower left corner. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large newspaper article that extends over two clippings from the Glasgow Herald on 26 January 1954. The clipping details the continuing trial of |Lord Montagu [297]|, |Peter Wildeblood [298]|, and |Michael-Pitt Rivers [299]|, focusing primarily on the testimony of |John Reynolds [303]| and describing an “all-male party of about 10 persons at Lord Montagu's beach hut\" where acts of “indecency” are said to have taken place %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |Jacop Epstein's [328]| sculpture of |T.S. Eliot [75]| %\r\n- a 1955 black and white photograph of |Andy Stewart [327]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a text-based clipping that Morgan has annotated as being from 7 April 1956. The clipping states that |Dylan Thomas's [136]| poetry and |Graham Greene's [326]| book are being published in the \"Soviet literary journal Inostrannaya\" %\r\n- a colour photograph of a flower with petals that resemble spines %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of an older man and woman seated at a table that is set with dishes (Patterson notes in her spreadsheet for the Digitising the Edwin Morgan Scrapbooks project that this may be a photograph of Morgan's parents) %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a posing pouch smiling and seated on a staircase %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a water-side town taken at a distance and from across the water  %\r\n- two black and white photographs showing airtight suits that workers in atomic plants can use to enter contaminated rooms. Above the photographs is short writeup, which reads: “Most of the work in atomic plants is done by machines so that men will not be exposed to deadly radiation. But to do certain delicate repair jobs in those zones where radioactive dust is the only danger, men have to walk right into badly contaminated rooms. Up to now they have had to wear bulky clothing which had to be buried after one use, made working awkward and gave only uncertain protection. Now a new airtight, paper-thin suit has been devised which gives more freedom to move about and more protection against plutonium dust. Designed by |Homer Moulthrop [329]| of the Atomic Energy Commission-General Electric Hanford plutonium plant at Richmond, Washington, it is made of polyethylene plastic which keeps the deadly dust off the worker’s skin and out of his lungs. With Moulthrop’s new suit, which his friends call ‘Homer’s Hideous Hallucination’, a technician simply dons ordinary coveralls, straps on a face mask through which he gets fresh air and crawls into the suit along its long tunnellike tail which opens into an adjoining room”. Morgan has annotated the clipping as being from 1954. %\r\n- a photograph of a carved sculptural human figure that Morgan has annotated as being from \"B. Congo\". The figure looks to be made out of a dark material, possibly stone. The figure is shown with their arms crossed, wearing a necklace and with bare feet  %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless man on a sandy beach standing in front of a surf board %\r\n- a 1761 clipping that describes the discovery of a coffin by miners in Cornwall. The article reads: “Tregoney in Cornwall, March 16. As some of our tinners were lately employed on a new mine, one of them accidentally struck his pickaxe on a stone. The earth being removed, they imagined, from its size, that it was a rock; but some characters perceived on a more close inspection, together with its shape and hollow sound, when struck, made them conclude it to be (what on opening it proved) a coffin. On removal of the lid they discovered the skeleton of a man of gigantic size, which, on the admission of the air, mouldered into dust. One entire tooth remained whole, which was two inches and a half long, and thick in proportion. The length of the coffin was eleven feet three inches, and depth three feet nine inches. (The inscription on the lid is desired.)”.",

Morgan has annotated the photographs as being originally taken in 1952. %\n- a 7 March 1955 Glasgow Herald article reporting on Australian fans and how they respond to celebrities. The clipping discusses the renown of |Norman Lindsay [337]|, the screaming fans that surrounded |Johnny Ray [338]|, including a woman who “burst through a police cordon at the airport” to grab on to the singer, and the controversy sparked by |Dame Nellie Melba [339]|, “who on being asked what were the Australian preferences in music, said ‘Sing ‘em muck.’” %\n- a black and white reproduction of a sketch captioned as: \"|Boris Godunov [340]|.

The write up reads: “Fifty years ago he was a familiar sight in the bars of Montmartre. A wild young man who painted the walls and streets of Paris with impassioned ecstasy, he was the son of an obscure painter named |Boissy [331]|, and |Suzanne Valadon [330]| – once a model of |Renoir [333]| and |Degas [334]|, and herself a painter. Today he is an officer of the Legion of Honour. Years of Bohemia have lined his face. A film is being made about him; he is involved in litigation over £200,000 worth of paintings which bear his signature, and which he never painted. But at last is well under control – there is a guardian angel, his wife, Lucie Valore.” %\n- a small text-based clipping that reads: “A small incendiary bomb may be carefully picked up if it is in a dangerous place, and carried to a place of safety. –A.R.P.

The clippings detail some of the statements given in court, including questions asked about letters written between Wildeblood and |Edward McNally [304]| and a question directed at Wildeblood quoted as \"How long have you known you were an invert\". Wildeblood is also quoted as saying that his relationship with McNally was based on the fact that he \"needed terribly badly to have some kind of affectionate relationship with somebody else\". Lord Montagu is reported as denying that he had sexual relations with |John Reynolds [303]|. %\r\n- a colour photograph captioned as: \"Samye Dzong Monastery on the northern bank of the Yalutsangpo River.

The author states that “A little scraped off a fresh brick with a knife makes an excellent cup of tea when boiling water is added”. The clipping includes a photograph of the brick and translates the stamp on the brick as reading: \"pure last year's tea\". Morgan has crossed out \"last year's tea\", however, and written his translation of \"Ceylon\". %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two men working in a tiled mechanic’s bay under a shiny new car. The coveralls of one of the mechanics reads “Buick” %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two people's heads.

These are microscopic algae (plant life) that may be an answer to world food problems\". The reporter begins the article by describing the algae: “What I ate was in the form of an olive green, freeze-dried, crumbling powder about the size of a lump of sugar. This was equal in food value to a similar sized piece of steak or cheese. It tasted like a mixture of yeast and spinach. And it clung to the roof of my mouth and teeth. It could be artificially flavoured. Or it could be mixed with other foods to give them added nutritional value”. The rest of the article focuses on the research of |Dr. Gordon Fogg [344]|, who is based at University College, London, on the ways in which nutrient-rich algaes can be used for food purposes. The article reports that collecting algae from the sea would be too expensive, but that algae farms could be the way forward.

This page includes four black and white photographs depicting a H-Bomb exploding and continues the photo series from pages 2252, 2254, and 2256. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- This page includes four black and white photographs depicting the H-Bomb explosion, which were published in the Illustrated News in 1954 and continues the photo series from pages 2252, 2254, and 2256. The first photograph includes a caption that reads: “The Illustrated London News – 587 April 10, 1954” %\r\n- an excerpt from an article titled \"Mexican Promoters Revive a Medieval Pastime\", which Morgan has annotated as being from 1954. The article describes a fight between a bull and a lion in Mexico City, and reports that, although the lion ripped the bull's tongue out, the bull managed to gut the lion with his horns. The article calls the event a \"barbaric stomach-turning spectacle\" and notes that the bull was rewarded for his victory by being \"dispatched at a local slaughterhouse and sold in the meat markets\". The article also reports that “university students, dressed in Roman togas, tried to halt the performace but were forced to flee by a barrage of missiles from the stands”, and that after the animal fight, “many spectators, possibly caught up in the spirit of the occasion, began fighting among themselves, bombarding one another with everything from cushions to bottles” %\r\n- Below the \"Mexican Promoters Revive a Medieval Pastime\" article, described above, Morgan has included a black and white photograph of the bull standing over the dead lion, which has been taken through metal bars. The photo is captioned as: \"END OF THE ACTION, after a savage five-minute battle in the 15-foot-square cage, comes as the mutilated bull stands panting and bleeding over his fallen adversary. This was upset victory, for lions usually triumph over bulls\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- an original black and white photograph of an empty room with two large arched windows %\r\n- a black and white zoomed-in photograph of an animal's eye %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a kangaroo %\r\n- a small colour photograph of jewels and stones %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a puppy leaning against a wooden frame (possibly a chair) %\r\n- a black and white photographic head shot of a young man who is looking directly into the camera without smiling %\r\n- an original colour photograph of a shirtless man seated on a short pillar with his back to the camera %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two boats travelling down a river with what might be a camera of some description in the first boat.

"Page_desc":"A page with a mix of black and white and colour clippings. This page includes a large newspaper clipping discussing the Lord Montagu trials. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a newspaper article from the Glasgow Herald on 24 March 1954 titled \"Montagu Case Verdicts Likely Today\". The article details the recent developments in the trials of |Lord Montagu [297]|, |Peter Wildeblood [298]|, and |Michel Pitt-Rivers [299]|. The article states that Judge |Ormerod [351]| left the summing-up of the trial incomplete the day before and recounts the advice from the judge regarding the evidence given to the jury by |McNally [304]| and |Reynolds [303]|. The judge is quoted as stating “I must warn, in the strongest terms, that it is dangerous in the extreme to convict a man upon the evidence of an accomplice unless that evidence is corroborated in some material particular by some outside and independent evidence”. The article clipping concludes by summarizing |Whittingstall’s [314]| statement in support of Lord Montagu and his concern over what he argues is the prejudiced nature of the trial, as well as with a statement given by |Hylton-Foster [352]|, in which he asked \"Is it likely that a man would import as the victim of his vice on his premises a creature he had never seen or heard about? It is now said that, because on a sunshiny holiday with chaps in bathing clothes in a beach hut they call one another by their Christian names, therefore it is the badge of some indecent association. Did ever snobbery put forward a more greasy exterior than that by the prosecution in this case?\" %\r\n- five clippings from a Max cartoon drawn by |Giovannetti [354]|, showing the character sweating in the sun, filling a hose with water, wrapping himself with the hose, and laying down on a shaded chair to cool off while holding a book open to read with his feet %\r\n- a short clipping titled “March of Science” and stating that the Hotel Tuscany in New York installed a radio transmitter to communicate with their serving staff, but that the frequency intersected with a teetotal guest's hearing aid, who \"left in a panic after a period of hearing a ghostly Big Brother ordering him to rush Martinis and whisky all over the hotel\". Morgan has annotated the clipping as being from July 1955 %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a cropped colour photograph of two men who appear to be crouching down near the head of dead animal with a large horn or tusk. The men appear to be talking to each other %\r\n- a vividly coloured photograph of blue and yellow flowers that Morgan has annotated as \"Algerian Iris & Mimosa\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a cat. The cat is seated and is photographed from the back. It is looking over its shoulder towards the camera %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a naked man shown from the thighs up with a towel around his waist. The man is holding the towel behind his back with both hands. He is looking to the left and is not smiling. %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a man shown from the shoulder up. His right arm is raised and bent at the elbow above his head and his elbow is resting against a shelf or wall of some sort %\r\n- a comical black and white photograph of two people hiding in a large urn. They are both wearing hats and are huddled together as if cold, or even afraid %\r\n- a black and white photograph of guitar player with amputated legs and metal artificial limbs standing in a street.

It focuses on the fear and the potential destruction surrounding the Cold War and its weapons, especially the Hydrogen Bomb.

The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white original photographic self portrait of |Edwin Morgan [1]| taken in a mirror. The mirror appears to be propped up on the seat of a chair rather than hanging on a wall.

The article discusses |Karl Buckthough's [355]| written warning to |Mr. D. M.

In response to this statement, a “Chorus” asks “What”, and Strauss repeats, “To take out a city, to destroy a city.” When “A Reporter” asks how big a city, Strauss says, “Any city.” %\r\n- a text-based clipping that Morgan has annotated as being from 1954 reports on |Eisenhower's [358]| faith in the United States to pull through \"the present dangerous times\", declaring that \"America is the greatest force that God has ever allowed to rest on His footstool\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of sand dunes, onto which Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a sign that reads: \"U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Savannah River Operations Office CONTRABAND Cameras, Film, Bombs, Incendiaries, Field Glasses, Binoculars, Electronic Sending & Receiving Devices, Dangerous Weapons, Alcoholic Beverages, Firearms, Explosives, Codes & Ciphers WARNING Persons having such unauthorized items in their possession are subject to such penalties as may be provided for by law, dismissal or other administrative action\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a person wearing a white hood over their face with eye-holes cut into it %\r\n- a bullet-point text-based clipping that discusses the time factors impeding the necessity of evacuating a city in order to save it from a Hydrogen Bomb.

And then some left over. And it won’t be long before there will be enough H-bombs alone to take care of all the targets certified for such a weapon. This means the Air Force and the Navy are running into a new problem in their rivalry for control over nuclear weapons; they are running out of suitable targets.”",

"Page_desc":"This page includes a mix of black and white and colour clippings, and features three clippings about the Lord Montagu trials.  The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large article from the Glasgow Herald dated 25 March 1954 and titled \"12-Month Sentence on Lord Montagu: Verdicts in Indecency Trial\". The article details the sentencing of |Lord Montagu [297]|, |Peter Wildeblood [298]|, and |Michael Pitt-Rivers [299]|. All three men were found guilty on charges of “indecency and unnatural offences”. Montagu received a 12-month prison sentence, and Wildeblood and Pitt-Rivers both received 18-month prison sentences. The article reports that “All three accused were found guilty of the charge of conspiring together on diverse dates between July 1, 1952, and October 31, 1952, in the counties of Southampton, London, and elsewhere, to incite two airmen, |Reynolds [303]| and |McNally [304]| to commit unnatural offences and gross indecency with male persons. In accordance with |Ormerod's [351]| direction, Lord Montague was found not guilty on two charges of attempting to commit an unnatural offence with Reynolds during August, 1952, in London, and on August 24, 1952, in the county of Southampton. The jury found him guilty of two charges of committing an act of gross indecency with Reynolds on those dates.” The article also states that “Wildeblood was found guilty of committing unnatural offenses on three occasions with McNally”, “guilty of gross indecency with McNally”, “guilty of counselling and procuring Lord Montagu to commit an act of gross indecency with Reynolds and of inciting McNally to commit an act of gross indecency with himself”. Pitt-Rivers was found “guilty on one charge of committing an unnatural offence with Reynolds”, of \"another charge of attempting to commit an unnatural offence with Reynolds”, and of “counselling and procuring Wildeblood to commit an unnatural offence with McNally”. The article also quotes the Judge’s statements, including his address to the three men, wherein he said “it is quite impossible for these offences to be passed over I am dealing with you in the most lenient way I possibly can do”. In regard to Montagu’s case, the Judge stated that “the evidence as to whether an attempted unnatural offence took place between Lord Montagu and Reynolds rested entirely on the evidence of Reynolds and the evidence did not go sufficiently far to warrant a verdict of guilty on those two charges. The jury knew there was still another charge pending against Lord Montagu, but they must not be prejudiced by that”. %\r\n- a small clipping that describes a crowd of about 300 people, some of whom \"booed and jeered\", that watched as McNally and Reynolds left the court with “a rug over their heads” %\r\n- a small article dated 7 November 1954, which states that \"Lord Montagu of Beaulieu was released secretly from Wakefield jail yesterday morning after serving eight months of the 12 months' sentence imposed last March\" %\r\n- a 1761 clipping from the London Chronicle, quoting the Gazetteer, that describes an \"eminent tradesman\" who \"was detected in attempting that horrible sin, now so much in practice, and taken in custody; but on giving 2000 l. security, he was admitted to bail\" %\r\n- a short clipping from Doubt magazine which reports on an \"unnamed Russ[ian] engineer on the Moscow radio\" who \"suggests building a dam across the Bering Strait separating the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans\". The engineer claims that the dam would allow \"warm Pacific water into the cold Arctic\" and so \"produce an artificial warm current about equal to that of the Gulf Stream, greatly moderating the climate in the Arctic Zone and North-Eastern Asia\" %\r\n- a captioned black and white reproduction of |Mervyn Peake's [362]| \"The Jabberwock\" illustration %\r\n- a black and white 1956 photograph of |Marlene Dietrich [361]|, which Morgan has dated and has annotated with the initials \"MD\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a headless stone figure, captioned as: \"Roman Temple Find. Among the finds made in the ruins of the Roman temple in the City is this one - pictured for the first time - part of a stone figure, probably 'Night,' one of the traditional attendants of the god |Mithras [360]|\", which Morgan has dated as September 1954 %\r\n- a clipping with two black and white photographs, each showing stone heads and collectively captioned as: \"Two important discoveries were made on the site of the Roman temple in the City of London last week: left, a marble head of the god Mithras, and, right, a marble head of a youth. It was stated last Tuesday that the cost of preserving the temple would be about £500,000. The Minister of Works promised to consider whether and how the money might be raised\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a small text-based clipping that reads: \"Good New Bra The 'Good News' bra stays up\" %\r\n- a colour photograph of a person paddling a small partially-covered boat near large rock formations %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a human eye %\r\n- a black and white photograph of what appears to be a mask %\r\n- a black and white photograph of several men who appear to be pulling down on something suspended above their heads (possibly a bell pull) %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless young man wearing a sailor's hat and crossing his arms over his chest %\r\n- a small colour photograph showing various jewels and stones.",

"Page_desc":"This page is themed around the myxomatosis virus outbreak among rabbits and includes a mix of black and white and colour clippings. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large newspaper headline and a section of the subsequent article from the Sunday Post on 18 July 1954 have been pasted together onto this page. The headline clipping reads: \"The Doom of the Rabbit\", and the article segment reports that |Mr. William Milne [367]|, a Scottish farmer, brought a diseased rabbit corpse back from England to infect rabbits on his property and is now receiving many requests for other corpses from farmers around Scotland. The clipping concludes by stating that “The R.S.P.C.A stated yesterday it now has mercy patrols operating in most parts of England and Wales to put an end to the suffering of rabbits infected by myxomatosis” Places named: Durris, Mearns., England, Banff, Dollar, Morayshire, Perth, Aberdeenshire, and Wales %\r\n- a newspaper clipping dated 19 July 1954, titled “Rabbit Disease in Eire” and reporting that the rabbit disease has been identified in Ireland, particularly in County Carlow. Places named: England, Australia, Ireland, and County Carlow %\r\n- a newspaper clipping titled “Killing Rabbits” that reads: “Sir, —In order to avoid handling the head or neck of a diseased rabbit— often a mass of sores— I have found it better to place my heel on its neck as the rabbit lies on the ground and pull the legs; this breaks the spinal cord and causes instantaneous death. —Yours truly, The Athanaeum. |G. Seligman [370]|” %\r\n- a newspaper clipping titled \"France Imports Rabbits: Repairing Disease Loss\" from the Glasgow Herald on 6 January 1955. The clipping reports that \"Thirty-six American cottontail rabbit are being flown to France to-day in an attempt to build up the rabbit population devastated by myxomatosis\". The cottontails are said to be hardy and it is hoped that they can withstand the disease %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- Morgan has pasted a small text-based clipping onto the lower portion of the “Doom of the Rabbit” article, described above. The small clipping reads: \"blind, deaf and paralysed before he is exterminated\", describing the awful state in which infected rabbits die %\r\n- a bullet-point article describing a timeline for myxomatosis, including the first appearance in 1897 at Montevideo, South America, its appearance within 10 years in California, the artificial introduction of the virus by |Sir Charles Martin [368]| at Cambridge, the introduction of the disease to Australia by |Dr. Francis Ratcliffe [369]|, an unnamed French doctor who introduced the disease in France and the spread of the virus around France, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Kent, Gloucestershire, and other parts of England and Wales. The clipping also reports that “Affected rabbits have the virus of the disease in their blood stream. A biting insect sucking blood from such a rabbit will carry over a certain amount of infection to the next rabbit it bites. During an outbreak a high proportion of rabbits became immune. It is suspected that the doe passes on in its milk a certain amount of immunity to the young, sufficient to counter the disease if bitten before weaning by an infected insect or flea. These young rabbits then develop very strong immunity” %\r\n- a text-based clipping reading: “Rabbits do £70,000,000 damage a year in Great Britain. Infected by the mass killer, myxomatosis, the rabbit dies—but in agony, 'a wretched creature, sightless, hairless, battering itself against the wall of the house,’ said a Kent farmer’s wife” %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a rabbit skeleton in a display case %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a statue showing a hunting scene that includes rabbits, dogs, and horses %\r\n- a colour photograph of a cracked and dried dirt lake bed, captioned as: \"A dry lake, called a playa, lies in the bottom of a valley in the Sonoran Desert\" %\r\n- pasted in the bottom left corner of the colour photograph of the dried lake, described above, is a black and white photograph of a diseased rabbit corpse. The rabbit clipping is captioned as: \"Below: a myxomatous rabbit - From 'The Rabbit\" (the photograph caption is slightly cut off, so Morgan has penned in the “it” of rabbit in both occurrences of the word in the caption). %\r\n- a colour photograph of two healthy rabbits, one of which is being stroked by a person.

"Page_desc":"This black and white page is largely textual. Many of the clippings on this page deal with issues of miscommunication, with particular emphasis on miscommunications surrounding the sinking of the Titanic. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a newspaper article from The Times dated 16 April 1912 and titled \"Titanic Disaster. Sunk After Collison with an Iceberg. Wireless Calls for Aid. Passengers Rescued by Other Liners\". The article extends over two clippings and reports that the Titanic has collided with an iceberg, was badly damaged, but that “the passengers were transferred to the Allan liner Parisian and the Cunard steamer Carpathia. The Titanic, in tow of the Allan liner Virginian according to the latest news, was making for Halifax”. The article states that the Titanic is said to be carrying 50 tons of rubber, tea, and consignments of diamonds. The names of several passengers on the Titanic are given: |Colonel J. J. Astor [372]|, |Madeleine Astor [373]|, |Major A. W. Butt [374]|, who is |President Taft’s [375]| aide-de-camp, |Mr. B. Guggenheim [376]|, |Mr. C. M. Hays [377]|, |Mr. Bruce Ismay [378]|, |Lady Rothes [379]|, |Mr. W. T. Stead [380]|, |Mr. Clarence Moore [381]|, |Mr. Isidor Straus [382]|, |Mr. George D. Widener [383]|, |Mr. Thomas Andrews [384]|, |Mr. Christopher Head [385]|. The article also names |Mr. G. A. Phillips [387]| and |Ann Phillips [388]| as the parents of the Titanic’s wireless operator |Jack Phillips [386]|. Places named in the clipping: Southampton, New York, North America, Halifax, Cape Race, Queenstown, Chelsea, Farncombe, and Godalming %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from The Times dated 16 April 1912 and titled \"Icebergs in the Atlantic. A Field Seventy Miles in Length\". The article reports that many ships, such as the Carmania, owned by |J. H. Welsford [390]|, have reported vast fields of icebergs and that at least one “full-fledged ship and one fishing smack are imprisoned in the floes”. The article states that “the extent of the ice was regarded as extraordinary, and the bergs appeared to be joined to the ice-field, which appeared as an enormous white line on the horizon”. Places named in the clipping: Arctic, Newfoundland, Newfoundland Grand-Banks, New York, Adriatic, Mediterranean, Liverpool, the Atlantic, and Halifax %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from The Times dated 18 April 1912 and titled \"Number of Survivors Now Said to be 705\". The article reports: “The Cunard Company has issued for publication a copy of a wireless message received from |Mr. Winfield Thompson [389]|, of the Boston Globe, who is a passenger on board the Franconia. The message says:—’The Franconia established communication with the Carpathia at 6.10 this (Wednesday) morning (New York time). The latter was more than 498 miles east of Ambrose channel and was in no need of assistance. She was steaming at 13 knots, and expected to reach New York at 8 o’clock on Thursday evening (New York time). She has a total of 705 survivors on board. The Franconia is relaying personal messages from the Carpathia to Sable Island” %\r\n- a newspaper clipping titled \"Aspects of the Disaster\" which reads: “Yesterday horror and sympathy were uppermost in the public mind. There was little room for anything except speculation, especially about the number and the identity of the survivors. People were paralysed by the suddenness with which what had been falsely represented as no more than a tremendous accident had been converted into an appalling catastrophe. To-day, while the horror and the sympathy are unabated and details are distressingly lacking, more attention is being paid to the broader aspects of the disaster. How was it that the Titanic, apparently, succumbed to a danger of the existence of which she is reported to have been aware? Could everybody have been saved? Had there been boats enough? What is the explanation of the fallaciously optimistic wireless reports with which on Monday the air teemed?” %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Tanguy's [371]| surrealist painting \"Slowly Toward the North\". The photograph is captioned and credited to the Museum of Modern Art. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of Tanguy. He is standing and holding a large empty frame, which largely frames his body in the photograph. Morgan has annotated the clipping as “Yves Tanguy 1954” %\r\n- a clipping of the full text of |Robert Graves' [392]| poem \"The Clearing\" %\n- pink and blue ink drawing on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\n- blue ink drawing on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a text-based clipping that reports on an interview with Tanguy, including a statement by Tanguy, which is quoted as \"Seeking is the important thing, not painting. You may think painting is to show something new, but no: |Picasso [346]| and |Dali [391]| do that, and they are monkeys. I don't want to show anything, or to teach anything\". Morgan has annotated this clipping as being from 1954.  Places named in the clipping: Hartford %\r\n- a newspaper clipping in response to the above described article, with a statement from Tanguy that reads: \"Sir: In reference to your Aug. 30 article under the heading \"Séance in Connecticut\": You have quoted me as saying that Dali and Picasso are monkeys. As I do not mean to doubt the veracity of your art editor, it is evident that there was a misunderstanding because of my difficulty in expressing myself in English. I believe, and said so, that the young artists who think they are saying something by changing their style or type of painting - as Dali and Picasso have done - are monkeys. This is strictly what I intended to convey . . . Yves Tanguy, Woodbury, Conn.\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a small terrier dog who is looking up directly at the camera %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of three men standing in a camp, two with their shirts partially off %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a person standing outside and holding a camera up to their eye %\r\n- a cropped colour reproduction of a detail from a painting.

"Page_desc":"This page displays a mix of black and white and colour clippings, and features a large newspaper clipping about UFOs and a colour collage that Morgan has compiled. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large newspaper clipping from the Evening News dated 1 June 1954 and titled \"'It Crossed City, Left Vapour Trails'\". The article details a sighting of a flying saucer by an ex-R.A.F. Glasgow man named |Thomas Robertson [393]|. Robertson describes the spinning disc he saw in the air. He described the object as being wingless, tailless, “circular”, and glinting “as if it was made of aluminum”. Robertson asserts that he had never before seen photographs of a flying saucer, nor could he have described \"what a flying saucer might look like\" before seeing the object. Upon seeing the object, he immediately phoned the Evening News office. The reporter states that “I ran out of the ‘News’ office, and sure enough in the sky above my head was a beautifully-formed vapour trail—so distinct that it was easily photographed through a red filter”. The reporter states further that neither Renfrew or Prestwick airports were active the day of the sighting, and no comment was provided by controllers from either airport about whether or not they thought the sighting was plausible. The article includes a photograph of Robertson and another man, possibly the reporter who wrote the article. Places named in the clipping: Parliamentary Road,  America, Glasgow, Renfrew Airport, Prestwick Airport %\n- a newspaper clipping dated 3 June 1954 and containing two letters from the Evening News's \"You Write\" section. The first is from |Mr. Darby [394]|, and although Darby says he saw a vapour trail at a different time than Robertson, he confirms that he saw something too. The second letter is from an anonymous writer who signs off as \"Navigator\". This writer states that \"In the relative quiet of the countryside to the east of Glasgow, I watched this object fly around for almost twenty minutes. Beyond any doubt it was a twin jet of the Meteor or Canberra type. It had a decided twin trail and the sound of the jets could be heard\" %\n- a black and white photograph of an ornate quiver, captioned as: \"A coating of a Scythian quiver\" and annotated by Morgan as being from 4 - 3 BC %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a black and white photograph of an engraving showing three human figures arranged vertically, shown in various poses that might suggest dance %\n- an original black and white photograph of a woman on a bicycle %\n- a black and white photograph of a dog balancing four teacups and a saucer on his nose %\n- a large colour photograph of the outside of a blast furnace building. Many flames can be seen through different parts of the building\n- along the left hand side of the blast furnace clipping, described above, Morgan has pasted a colour photograph of the torso and lower body of a man leaning back in a chair, almost as if the man is reclining in front of a fireplace, with the fireplace being represented by the blast furnace\n- in the bottom left corner of chair clipping, described above, Morgan has pasted a third clipping that reads: \"1 Only - Rocking Chair £12\" and, in letters typed upside down on the clipping, \"Less than half price!

"Page_desc":"This page is black and white and almost wholly textual. It features a large newspaper article detailing the sinking of the Titanic that extends over 6 clippings. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large newspaper article from The Times dated 20 April 1912 and titled “Survivors’ Stories: |Mr. Beesley’s [395]| Graphic Account”. The article contains Beesley’s account of the sinking of the Titanic. He describes feeling a slight jar when the impact occurred, but that no alarm was raised at first. Only after the engines stopped did concern rise. Soon after, the lifeboats were lowered and women were put into the boats first. Beesley says that all of this occurred with “no trace of disorder”. When all the ladies on deck were in a boat, Beesley reports a half-full boat being opened to men, which he himself got on. He reports 60-70 people in his life boat. He also describes an incident wherein his boat was almost hit by another life boat being lowered off the side of the Titanic. By 2am, Beesley reports that the Titanic was sinking in earnest, “tilted straight on end with the stern vertically upwards”. When the last of the huge ship sunk beneath the waves, Beesley describes “the most appalling noise that human being ever heard—the cries of hundreds of our fellow beings struggling in the icy water, crying for help with a cry that we knew could not be answered. We longed to return to pick up some of those who were swimming, but this would have meant the swamping of our boat and the loss of all of us” Places named in the clippings: Queenstown, Southhampton, Dulwich College, Wirksworth Grammar School, Derby School, and Cambridge. %\r\n- a pink and blue ink doodle on the scrapbook page drawn by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a short clipping that appears to have a typo in the title. The clipping reads: \"SINATRA’S BIG MOUTH. This is |Frank Sinatra's [396]| big month. He stars in two excellent films showing in 30 cinemas throughout Southern California\" %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a naked man wearing a hat and kneeling down while holding a guitar in front of his groin %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a snowy scene that Morgan has annotated as: \"Ben Nevis summit c.1900\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man on a sailing boat working on the sail. Another boat can be seen sailing in the background %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man lying on the ground in what looks to be a forest.

The article goes on to discuss Aebersold's methods using radioisotopes, and states that the human body \"should not be considered permanent in any material sense,\" although in a larger sense, \"the atoms that each human body is made of were once parts of other living things—e.g., dogs, whales, birds. The atoms that made up |Plato [406]| and |Henry VIII [405]| are still floating around as parts of people now living\" %\r\n- a 1955 clipping titled:“Grauballe Man on View”.

It also states that “|Rear Admiral Lewis L. Strauss [415]|, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, has suggested that Brookhaven may have found a practical method of packaging radioactive materials as useful sources of energy\".

The language he uses is full of allusion, simile, and metaphor. For example, when explaining why he took so long to reply to Caetani’s letters, he says: “I buried my head in the sands of America; flew over America like a damp, ranting bird; boomed and fiddled while home was burning; carried with me, all the time, my unfinished letters, my dying explanations and self-accusations, my lonely half a loony maybe-play, in a heavy, hurtful bunch. These ostrich griefs were always with me, and whispered loudest in the late night when, indeed, I was all sand”. Morgan has annotated the letter as \"(Dylan Thomas)\".

"Page_desc":"A black and white page that contains several large text-based clippings, many of which deal with behavior presented in the clippings as deviant, rebellious, or even immoral. Most of the image-based clippings are small, except for a large black and white photograph of two boys dressed in suits, one of whom is smoking. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large newspaper clipping from the Observer by |Edward Crankshaw [430]|. The article is dated 20 June 1954 and focuses on the reception of a report by |Kinsey [435]|, titled \"The Sexual Behaviour of the American Female\", in the Soviet Union. The article discusses an attack by |Leonov [437]| on Kinsey's report and the ways in which sexual politics and family life are being framed, politicized, and discussed in the Soviet Union. Overall, Leonov frames Kinsey as \"an instrument in the campaign\" that Leonov says tries to \"make man into beast, to spread the law of the animal world over human society in order to pervert and falsify the laws of social development, to justify war, to justify the lack of rights and the poverty of the workers, to justify the law of 'might is right’\". Leonov calls the book \"the most cheap kind of pornographic hash, clumsily disguised as science\" and states that “It is clear that pornography in itself fulfils a definite social demand. Eroticism and debauchery have always served reaction as a means of distracting people from the daily struggle”, but, for Leanov, Kinsey’s book is “designed to debauch the American people in the interests of a predatory Government by persuading them of the legitimacy of giving way to all their animal impulses at all times”. Crankshaw says that the Kremlin is “concerned with the growth of immorality in the Soviet Union” under |Stalin [436]| and Stalinism. The Kremlin has started publishing reports of crimes and their penalties, while also glorifying the “ideal of harmonious marriage and family life”. Crankshaw observes that this glorification has been carried out without mention of Communism, and he blames the government, not the Soviet people, for the “wave of cynical licentiousness which is now officially admitted”. Crankshaw therefore suggests that “by linking sexual licence, as reported by Dr. Kinsey, with the ’reactionary’ policies of Washington and by seeking to demonstrate its politico-sociological foundations, the Kremlin is preparing to lift immorality into the political sphere so that it may be denounced as ‘a remnant of the bourgeois capitalist mentality’ and attacked and punished as such” %\n- a clipping from Doubt magazine, which reads: “|Dr. Jose M. R. Delgado [431]|, Yale School of Medicine, keeps his misshapen dwarf soul and whatever he has for a body together by sticking electric wires into holes in monkeys’ heads and sending shocks through ‘Anywhere from 7 to 40 wires,’ the Chicago Daily News Service told the Pittsburgh Press, 4-10-1953. ‘When the current is turned off, the monkey reverts to normal.’ And what does Dr. Delgado revert to: Cannibalism, perhaps?” %\n- a black and white cartoon drawing of a shirtless man in water up to his waist who is scratching his torso vigorously. The image is captioned as: \"The solution? 'Coming up to scratch.' In Figures of Speech (Gollancz: 8s 6d) by |Mervyn Peake [362]|\" %\n- a black and white film still from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea showing a group of people in scuba diving gear walking on the sea floor %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a 1954 clipping on the return of |Diego Rivera [432]| to Mexico's Communist Party at age 67 after his excommunication years earlier. The clipping reads: In need of names to brighten its roster, Mexico’s short-handed (membership barely 5,000) Communist Party offered a bittersweet welcome to a long-lost comrade, Painter Diego Rivera, 67. In 1929, Comrade Rivera was excommunicated because of his growing list of deviations. He had fallen into habits of firing off peppery pronunciamentos without first clearing them with the proper Red monitors. Confessed loose-lipped Rivera: ‘I got kicked out for shooting off my mouth.’ He later even gave haven in his home for two years to |Leon Trotsky [433]|. Back in the fold again last week, Rivera was strangely mum. In tragic truth, he was tired, in bad health and grieving over the recent death of his wife”. The clipping also includes a photograph of Rivera, captioned as: “Diego Rivera Pepper.” %\n- a large black and white photograph focused on two young men dressed in suits, one of whom is smoking a cigarette. Neither boy is looking at the camera, and other boys can be seen in the background of the photograph. The photograph may have been taken at a dance or similar event. In the top right corner of the clipping, Morgan has written \"London 1954\" %\n- in the bottom left corner of the photograph of the boys in suits, described above, Morgan has pasted a line of text that reads: \"Will assist Strangers living in London to meet the RIGHT people\" %\n- a text-based clipping reading: “The first atom bomb exploded over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. On August 11, after five days of almost indescribable suffering, the people of the city spoke of the annihilating weapon as Pika-don—“flash-boom’; they had not yet heard of the atom bomb. On that day a man from a neighboruing town visited the Hiroshima Communications Hospital ‘with the incredible story that Japan had the same mysterious weapon’ and that a squadron of Japanese bombers had now used it on the mainland of America. The effect of this report is noted by |Dr. Hachiya [434]| in his diary: At last Japan was retaliating! The whole atmosphere in the ward changed, and for the first time since Hiroshima was bombed everyone became cheerful and bright. Those who had been hurt the most were happiest. Jokes were made, and some began singing the victory song” %\n- an article dated 21 March 1955 and titled “The stewards at a Saturday dance in the Orange Halls, Paisley, noticed a bulge in the pocket of a 16-year-old youth. They searched him—and found an axe, a knife, and a chain in his possession”. The article quotes |Depute Fiscal James Smith [442]| as stating that the youth “came prepared today for anything but dancing”. The youth is described as being from the north side of Glasgow, having long wavy hair, and wearing a long jacket and skin-tight trousers. He appeared before |Sheriff Hunter [443]| and was ordered to be “detained in prison until a Borstal report was obtained” %\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless man lying on the ground and leaning against a wagon wheel. The man’s back is to the camera and he is wearing a cowboy hat, jeans, and boots %\n- a black and white photograph, which may be a still from a movie and shows a large robot and several men. One of the men appears to be pointing a gun at the robot. The three figures are in a room with windows, through which a mountainous landscape can be seen %\n- an original black and white photograph of a shirtless man sitting cross-legged on the ground. The background of the photograph is white with no detail. The man’s body is facing the camera, but he is looking over his shoulder to the left and he is not smiling %\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a human eye.",

"Page_desc":"This page is comprised of a few large clippings, most of which are black and white, except for one colour reproduction of a painting titled “Boy with Squirrel”. A large article excerpt that extends over two clippings takes up much of the page and discusses Soviet media reporting of youth deviance. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large article excerpt from the Spectator that extends over two clippings and is dated 15 October 1954. The clipping reports that “In the past few months there have been over 50 articles in the central Press alone on youthful alcoholism and hooliganism, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Young Communist organ, sometimes running to three a week. It has all been on a high political level: indeed KP has twice had to rebuke a number of local youth papers for ‘sensationalism’—for instance that in Orel which printed the photograph of a youth whose sole claim to fame was that he had travelled without a shirt on a bus, thus revealing ‘the indecent inscription tattooed on his chest.’ Drunkeness is condemned as a ‘survival of capitalism’—though it is difficult to see how capitalism could have had much influence on, for instance, the ‘thief and drunkard’ aged 7 mentioned in a talk over Moscow Radio on August 24. Case after case of promising youth workers and schoolboys, most of them Komsomols, who fall into drink and hooliganism, might lead the reader to wonder where they get the liquor. Vodka is, after all, a state monopoly, both in its production and its sale. KP has been backing the local Komsomol in a feud with the state trade agencies in Rostov, but the only victory has been that a factory youth canteen now sells vodka out of the window only, which it claims to be outside the factory’s jurisdiction. Meanwhile every soft drinks stand for streets around really sells vodka only. And there are similar reports from Moscow and elsewhere. Even in the schools themselves, the position is not good. For example, Izvestia early this year mentioned a school, considered one of the best in Khabarovsk, where violence and theft were ‘systematic’; one boy had been beaten to death, and another, aged 11, was under arrest for knifing a master while under the influence of drink. Technical schools for older boys are regularly denounced as haunts of hooliganism. KP of February 18, after a routine description of the boozing, thieving and beating up indulged in by the pupils of one of those who are out in town, describes the activities of those who stay in their hostel—‘gambling or copying indecent verses into their albums.’ At the Komsomol Congress in March, its Secretary, |Shelepin [440]|, attacked the young stilyags, with tarzan haircuts and parrot-like dress who populate the streets of Moscow, Leningrad, Tiflis and other cities, neither working nor studying. The stilyags are in a different category from the ordinary hooligan—they are the spoiled (and usually drunk) sons of rich and influential parents and have long been regularly attacked and caricatured. But only minor figures are pilloried personally, and then only in particularly outrageous cases. Effective condemnation of favouritism is not to be expected in a country where the notoriously stupid and unpleasant son of the Prime Minister became a Lieutenant-General of Aviation at the age of 29. Literaturnaya Gazeta of June 26 quotes a case of four youths aged 15-17 who were holding up passers-by with revolvers. It was not this which struck the paper as extraordinary so much as the fact that that, since one of the accused was the son of a police captain (and in fact used his father’s police revolver for his crimes), not only were they not charged, but the sergeant who pulled them in was sentenced for unlawful arrest. It is not, indeed, only robbing and hooliganism which are dealt with. Trud, for instance, attacks the euphemistically named ‘butterflies’ who prowl the centre of Moscow at night for ‘good times’, men and money” %\n- a large colour reproduction of |John Copley's [438]| \"Boy with Squirrel\" painting %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a large black and white photograph of three boys lying on their stomachs on a beach. Two of them are playing chess, while the third watches. In the bottom left corner, Morgan has written \"Odessa 1954\" in blue ink %\n- a small cropped black and white photograph of several people in kilts, at least one of whom is holding bagpipes %\n- a black and white photograph of a man wearing only underwear and standing with his back to the camera. His arms are extended backwards from his sides and he is stretching a band or piece of fabric between his arms and behind his back %\n- a small text-based clipping reading: “One of the stories he told us was that |Dame Nellie Melba [339]| never went on to the platform to sing without first receiving her cheque, which she thrust into the bosom of her dress” %\n- a small text-based clipping reading: “\"WANTED - A domesticated lady to live with an elderly lady to hell with the cooking and housework — Notice in agency window” %\n- a black and white photograph of a white horse splashing through water %\n- Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a sculpture of two men in a curling wave onto the clipping of the white horse. He has pasted it over the white horse’s hind legs, making it appear either as if the wave is part of the horse’s splashing or is a chariot of some sort being pulled by the horse %\n- Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a shirtless man posing in a sailor's hat and white trousers in the lower right corner of the photograph of the white horse.",

"Page_desc":"This page includes a mix of black and white and colour clippings. The image-based clippings are arranged to frame a centrally-placed, text-based clipping that discusses a dispute between France and Russia over several Picasso paintings. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |James Joyce [175]| dressed in a suit, a hat, a cane, and an eyepatch. The photograph is captioned as: “Author James Joyce” and is credited to |Stuart Gilbert [446]| %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Chen Chih-Fu's [444]| painting \"Narcissus\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- an article clipping dated 1954 which discusses a dispute of ownership regarding \"thirty-seven Picasso paintings (valued at about half a million dollars)\" sent from Moscow and Leningrad. The paintings are owned by the Soviet Union, but while on loan to Paris for an exhibit, |Mme. Keller-Shchukin [441]| claimed that she had originally owned the paintings before the Soviets \"illegally confiscated the paintings without compensation\". She therefore sued in a French court, upon which point the Russians took the paintings away, “presumably to diplomatic immunity in the Soviet Embassy”. A French judge eventually ruled that the \"French courts had no jurisdiction over the Bolshevik revolution and its artistic policies\", and the exhibition reopened. The article quotes |Picasso [346]|, who stated \"What would happen if, one of these days, the Comte de Paris (pretender to the French throne) should get a notion into his head to claim ownership of the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles?\" The article also says that this dispute comes on the heels of a “cancellation of the Soviet ballet performances” in France %\r\n- a small text-based clipping is included on this page, titled \"Clippiegram\". The clipping is in Scots and reads: \"See thon conductor wi' the Yoonie scarf - says he's daein' maths wi' Nat Phil - peety Nat cannae learn him to get his money right, but.\" %\r\n- a large colour photograph of several sailing boats on the water.

"Page_desc":"This page is taken up almost wholly by a full-page colour clipping from Collier’s magazine titled “MEN WILL CONQUER SPACE SOON” that Morgan has used as the foundation for a collage. One of these collage items is the clipped word \"Forse\", which translates in Italian to \"Maybe\", changing the meaning of the title to “Maybe Men Will Conquer Space Soon”.  Above this full-page clipping, Morgan has pasted four black and white clippings along the top of the page. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- A colour title page from Collier's 22 March 1952 article \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon\". The title page features a colour drawing of a spacecraft, a small yellow planet or moon, and the circular rotating space station drawn by von Braun. The title page also includes a colour photograph of several men sitting around a boardroom table, with the caption \"Some of the scientists and illustrators who took part in Collier's symposium (left to right): |Rolf Klep [448]|, |Willy Ley [449]|, |Dr. Heinz Haber [450]|, |Dr. Wernher von Braun [451]|, |Dr. Fred L. Whipple [452]|, and |Chesley Bonestell [453]|\". On a large desk in front of the men in the photograph is a desk with many papers and notepads, and on one of these notepads, Morgan has written the date 1952 in pink pen %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a multi-part sculpture that includes a sculpture of a human ear. The sculpture is photographed against a brick wall. In the upper left corner of the clipping, Morgan has pasted a caption, which identifies the sculpture, and reads:  \"|F.E. McWilliam [447]|. Head in Extended Order. Study for a pediment. 1948. Hoptonwood Stone. Length 24 ins.\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- onto the full-page Collier’s clipping and above the photograph of the men, Morgan has pasted in a colour photograph of a book open to an illustrated page that appears to show two astronauts on a red planet with a Saturn-like planet visible in the sky. %\r\n- above the title, \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon\" in the full-page Collier’s clipping, Morgan has pasted in the clipped word \"Forse\", which translates in Italian to \"Maybe\", changing the meaning of the title to “Maybe Men Will Conquer Space Soon”. %\r\n- in the bottom right corner of the full-page Collier’s clipping, Morgan has included a black and white photograph of a naked man lying with his back to the camera. The man's legs are extended out beside him and he is propped up on one elbow, with his other arm extended upwards. In this pose, he resembles Adam from the Sistine Chapel paintings %\r\n- a black and white movement sequence photograph of a male dancer as he moves through a jump turn. He is wearing tights and a white shirt %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a boy dressed in a suit standing in front of a parking lot full of cars.

A version of this illustration appeared as part of a portfolio by Emett for Life magazine in 1954, which may be from where this clipping was taken. %\r\n- Morgan has included the caption written by Emett for the painting described above as a separate clipping. The caption reads: \"White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. Everybody knows that other planets are becoming keenly interested in the scientific goings-on in the desert. Here a flying saucer, slightly off course, has landed and is carefully dissecting a piece of pure American science to see what makes it tick.\" The \"American science\" referred to appears to be a train engine. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of Emett with one of his inventions, which appears to be built around an umbrella.

He forgot he had done so, however, and, thinking the wig missing, asked a woman \"if she had seen a hassock o' hair among her feet\". The article also states that the clergyman only laughed three times in his life, one of those times taking place when a pudding on the fire \"happened to cheep from the expulsion of air\" during grace, causing a small child present to say \"Weesht, weesht, pudy, ...naebody maun speak here, but the man 'at seeks the blessing\" %\r\n- a short clipping that reads: \"If your cat is lively most of the time, eats all its food and keeps it down, and there is no obvious sign of illness, then you can be sure there is nothing very seriously wrong with it, whatever other strange things it may be doing\".",

"Page_desc":"This page contains mostly black and white clippings, except for one large colour photograph of fishermen in front of a large waterfall. This page includes several text-based clippings, including two clippings wherein not guilty pleas are being argued based on mental illness or trauma. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large black and white photograph taken from Life magazine showing a steel mill in Dusseldorf Germany in the background and steel workers bicycling home from work in the foreground %\r\n- a large newspaper clipping from the Sunday Mail dated 29 August 1954. The clipping reports on the sentencing of |Juliet Hulme [465]| and |Pauline Parker [466]|, two sixteen-year-olds found guilty of murdering Parker's mother, |Honora Mary Parker [467]|. The clipping headline reads: \"After six days of sensational evidence, two 16-year-old girls, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, were found guilty in Wellington, New Zealand, yesterday of murdering Pauline's mother. Without a trace of emotion, they heard the judge sentence them to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure. As sentence was passed on Pauline, a young man in the gallery shouted, 'I protest, I object'\". The article states that the protester was “hurried out by police” and continues to say that: “It was June 22 this year that Honora Mary Parker, aged 45, was battered to death in a Christchurch park by a brick enclosed in a nylon stocking. Her daughter, Pauline, and her close friend, Juliet Hulme, who was born in England and is the daughter of |Dr. H. R. Hulme [468]|, former Director of Operation Research at the Admiralty, claimed that Mrs. Parker had slipped and killed herself”. The article describes the girls as showing \"calm detachment\", not wearing makeup, and not showing remorse. The article states that diary extracts, which were revealed in court, suggest that there were \"abnormal sexual relations between the girls”, that they had tried to break all Ten Commandments, and that they had “built a temple for a dead mouse in the garden”. During the trial, medical opinion on the girls’ sanity is reported as divided, but the article concludes with a statement by |Dr. Francis Bennett [469]| for the defense, which is quoted as: “To us—sane, I hope—it was murder so bestial, treacherous and filthy that it was outside all kindly limits of sanity” %\r\n- above the Hulme and Parker article, Morgan has pasted a text-based clipping, which reads: \"A Story of Adventure in New Zealand\" %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from the Bulletin dated 19 January 1955 reports that a man named “|Williams [470]|, North Warnborough, Hampshire, was charged with conducting himself in a disorderly manner in the home of an 18-year-old girl student. The girl, |Miss Phyllis Piddington [471]|, of London, said that when Williams called at the house at which she was staying in Dogmersfield, he looked ill.  Williams said he had colic and that he should have weights placed on his stomach. He usually had some one stand on him. ‘I didn’t know what to do,’ said Miss Piddington. ‘He lay on the floor and I stood on his stomach for about a minute. It seemed longer. He said I was not heavy enough. When I told him there was a large man next door he said a woman would be better. So I fetched a woman from next door and we both stood on his stomach. After we had stood on his stomach two or three times he said he felt better and went away.’ A detective constable said there had been a number of complaints from women about a man who had asked them to stand on his stomach. Williams, who admitted he was the man, said that he asked the women to stand on his stomach because he was interested in weight-lifting. He also said he had had a serious accident on a motor bicycle and felt he was not responsible for his actions. The case was adjourned for four weeks for a medical report.” %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a self-portrait painted by |Stanley Spencer [463]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large colour photograph of two people fishing downstream of a large waterfall. The two people are standing on rocks in the river bed and appear to be using fly rods %\r\n- a short piece titled \"Strong-man vandal,\" which reports that \"Twelve telephone directories have been torn in two in Salisbury kiosks during 11 days\". Morgan has annotated the clipping with “DE 3-1-1959” %\r\n- a text-based clipping that describes how to train yourself to swallow saws, stating that you should \"Begin with a smooth iron bar, bent at a right angle at the top to keep it from slipping all the way down your throat. Tickle the back of your throat with it for a practice period every day until the gagging reflex is subdued, and then just let it slide down slowly. You require a lot of practice before you can swallow a saw\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless man in shorts kneeling on a mat on the floor and bending at the waist over his knees with his hands extended in front of him %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless man holding what appears to be a bar above his head %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a leaning pillar, behind which a man's arm and leg can be seen. Morgan has cut the clipping on an angle to follow the line of the pillar, and in the triangular space left on the scrapbook page, |Morgan [1]| has drawn red and blue ink spirals %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a naked man lying on his stomach on a padded bench. There is drapery in the background and a large piece of silken-looking fabric is spilling over the edge of the bench and onto the floor.",

When the well came in, Mrs. Cook and her husband jubilantly greased each other's cheeks.\" %\r\n- above the photograph of the three women, Morgan has pasted in two lines of text, which together make up a headline that comes from the same Life article as the photograph. The headline reads: \"Waiting in Texas to Get Rich Quick\" %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from the Bulletin, dated 2 November 1954, which describes a ceremony performed by the |Pope [473]| at St Peter’s. The article states that a \"glittering crown of diamonds, topazes, sapphires, and aquamarines\" was fixed \"to a painting of the |Madonna [41]|\", which was supposed to have been painted by |St. Luke [474]|. The ceremony \"instituted a new feast devoted to the 'Queen of Heaven'\" and included \"25 cardinals and 385 bishops\". The article also reports that the ceremony was seen by over 300,000 people in person, was televised for Italians, and was \"broadcast over nearly half the national radio networks of Europe.\" Morgan included the headline of this article in his clipping, but he altered it by pasting a second clipping, which reads: “|Queen Mother [479]|”, over the latter part of the headline.

The clipping praises Picasso and reads: “Si vous n’avez vu |Picasso [346]| que sur des images, je voudrais vous le décrire. Il est très petit, avec des pieds et des mains charmants, des yeux terribles dont les vrilles s’enfoncent à l’extérieur et l’intérieur. L’intelligence gicle de lui comme l’eau de la pomme d’un arrosoir. Il arrive qu’on prenne froid sous cette douche, mais on en tire toujours bénéfice. Ses paroles à l’emporte-pièce dépassent souvent ce qu’il veut dire : or il est rare qu’en y réfléchissant le lendemain on n’en prenne pas leçon et que sa clairvoyance pleine de grâce et de dureté ne nous enseigne notre propre contrôle. Au reste, il aime les formules. J’avais dit qu’il avait donné la vie à ses colombes de terre-cuite en leur tordant le cou. Il colportait cette boutade, car lui-même formule continuellement. Il n’est pas discours, il est formule. Jamais son lyrisme ne se répand, n’est d’ordre torrentiel. Il se ramasse et se sculpte en objets autour desquels on peut se promener, qu’on peut toucher, et qui doivent leur efficace à un rayonnement interne. \" %\r\n- a black and white newspaper photograph of a carved statue captioned as: \"Figure carrying a vase\", which Morgan has annotated as \"Sardinia B.C.\"%\n- a black and white photograph of a carved animal statue captioned as: \"cow(?) standing, from the Abini group; length 3 1/8 inches\" %\n- a black and white newspaper photograph of a carved sculpture of a boat with what looks like several small animals stacked inside. The photograph is captioned as: \"Model of a boat with a head of deer carved on the prow\" and Morgan has annotated it as \"Sardinia B.C.\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a short text-based clipping that states \"there is, alas! no scientific confirmation for the existence of the hoop snake that has so often been seen, in the rye whiskey and applejack regions of the United States, bowling rapidly along the road with its tail in its mouth like a wheel without spokes\" %\r\n- four numbered and separately clipped black and white photographs with the collective caption \"In the Zoological Institute one can see quite a number of animals which until recently were quite unknown to science. 1. A new genus of Amphipoda. 2. A fish caught at a depth of 23,714 feet. 3. A butterfly caught in the Southern Kazakhstan steppes and not yet classified. 4. A new echinoderm discovered near the Kuril Islands\". The caption has been clipped as part of the photograph numbered 1. Above the caption, Morgan has added the date 1954 and has written \"Leningrad\" above the words \"Zoological Institute\". Morgan has also added a number 4 to the corner of the fourth photograph, as the number seems to have been clipped away %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a shirtless man photographed from the waist up holding a spear. He has the spear lifted in one hand, with the sharpened end pointing down and to the right %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shirtless woman photographed outside. She is standing in a body of water and is using a ladle that looks like it is made from a coconut shell to fill a woven basket with water %\r\n- a colour photograph of a white cat with one green eye and one blue eye photographed against a blue background. The cat’s mouth is open wide %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a jet in flight above clouds %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a young solider standing with his hands in his pockets. He is wearing a helmet and is looking directly into the camera without smiling %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a white window frame on the side of a dark building %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a nude man seated with his knees bent towards his chest. The man is looking up and to the left with a slight smile %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a speedo-style swimsuit standing outside in a rocky landscape and flexing his muscles %\r\n- onto the clipping of the flexing man, Morgan has pasted a small text-based clipping that reads: \"Don Reyes\".  \r\n",

"Page_desc":"This page is wholly visual and contains a mix of colour and black and white clippings. The page features a progressive series of otherwise black and white photographs that have been tinted yellow. The series has been arranged around the top half of the page. The central image on the page is a colour photograph of a Greek soldier in uniform and this image is largely framed by the photographs from the series. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a progressive series of otherwise black and white photographs that have been tinted yellow. The series extends over at least the three clippings that Morgan has included on this page. The first photograph shows a wooden apparatus on a stand with a round hole drilled through it. Each of the following three photographs zoom in a little more on the hole, allowing the viewer to see more and more of the scene behind the apparatus. By the fourth photograph, the hole is no longer the focus. The focus instead becomes two rocks that can be viewed through the hole, one of which is curved and itself has a large circular hole in the middle of it. In the last photograph, the edges of the wooden hole are completely out of the frame and the photograph captures the two rocks unimpeded. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a human eye %\r\n- a colour photograph of a Greek soldier in the full Evzones uniform, which includes a red Farion hat and Foustanella (resembling a kilt). The soldier is holding a gun over his shoulder and is marching on a tiled surface %\r\n- a colour photograph of two pipes in a long ditch %\r\n- onto the photograph of the pipes, described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a shirtless man photographed from the waist up. The man is leaning back with his arms behind his head, and may be in the process of doing a sit-up %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a group of young men in uniform standing on the street and waving their hats. Their hats and uniforms suggest they may be French navy %\r\n- a black and white cartoon of a photographer under a drape sheet setting up to take a photograph of a woman in a burka %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a nude man standing on sand in front of a rock formation.

Around him are a square and an oval and it appears that another figure is standing back to back with the man, as the backs of two legs are visible next to the man's legs, and the backs of two arms are visible extending above the man's head. There is also what looks to be a fifth leg extending from the man's hip, although this may perhaps be a suggestion of movement, similar to Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The caption reads: \"Ode. Programme cover by Pavel Tchelitchev (No. 352)\" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of the cover of |Calvin Hoffman's [487]| 1955 book, The Man Who Was Shakespeare, which displays a portrait of |William Shakespeare [19]| and a portrait of |Christopher Marlowe [240]| %\r\n- a clipping that includes two black and white reproductions of watercolour paintings by |Adolf Hitler [486]|, captioned collectively as: \"Water colours by the Fuehrer. Above, 'House With a White Fence,' painted during the first World War; below, 'The Old Yard, Munich'\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a naked man crouching down with his head bent down. One elbow rests on his thigh while his hand touches his face %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man's face. The man is facing the camera, but his eyes are looking slightly to the left.

The photograph is taken from above, likely either from high ground or as an aerial photograph %\r\n- an original photograph of a loch surrounding by hills, which are reflected on the water's surface %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two nude men wrestling. One man has the second man in a hold. One of the second man’s arms is being held behind his head and the other arm is being held behind his back %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man who is holding and hovering his body up in a seated position above a chair.

The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a text-based clipping from a 1955 issue of Boy’s Life reading: \"Dear Zany Amanuensis: I am amazed to note the\" %\r\n- a text-based clipping that reads: “While I was running to catch a bus I heard a voice shout: ‘Hey, mister.’ I looked round and saw two old ladies looking at something on the ground. It was my hand. I have an artificial right arm. |Bill Dalgleish [490]|, 38 Eighth Street, Newtongrange” %\r\n- a Sunday Post newspaper clipping dated 29 January 1956 and titled \"Look at Your Hands\". The clipping recounts a scientific study that claims \"people whose ancestors came from different parts of Europe have different distribution of hair on the middle joints of their fingers.\" Next to a paragraph reading: \"If you have no hair at all growing on these joints, your ancestors came from Spain, Italy, or Ireland\", Morgan has written \"(EM)\" with a checkmark. Hair on only the mid-joints of the ring finger is said to indicate South-Eastern origin, hair on only the mid-joints of the ring and index fingers is said to indicate ancestry from Austria, Northern Italy, or Switzerland, and hair on all but the mid-joints of the index finger is said to indicate “ancient British stock” or ancestry from Germany, Scandinavia, or Northern France. The clipping also states that “if you have hair on all the mid-joints, you can count yourself one of the world’s aristocracy. It’s a very rare occurrence, and since examples occur almost equally all over Europe the scientists conclude you must be from the widely-scattered cave-dwellers of the Stone Age” %\r\n- a black and white photograph from Life magazine of two empty work gloves resting on the handles of a drill that is planted in concrete %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- on the bottom of the Life magazine photograph of the drill and gloves, describe above, Morgan has pasted a small colour photograph of a hand and a ruffled sleeve. The clipping is pasted so that the hand reaches straight up %\r\n- a colour photograph of a woman's hand held in an Indian mudra position. The woman's gold sleeve and gold bracelet are also visible in the photograph %\r\n- a colour photograph of a hand holding the neck of a guitar. The photograph has been shot from behind, so the neck of the guitar, rather than the string board, is visible %\r\n- a cropped black and white reproduction of a drawing of skeleton. The clipped portion of the image shows the arm and hand of the skeleton, which extends straight down from the shoulder with the palm facing out %\r\n- a cropped black and white reproduction of a drawing showing a rhinoceros and a skeleton's arm extending from the left side of the image over the rhinoceros, almost as if to pet it. No other part of the skeleton is visible in this clipping %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a drawing of a hand with six fingers and a thumb %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a pin-board with hand-shaped pins holding up notes %\r\n- a text-based clipping that reads: \"Thumb he, / Wizbee, / Longman,/ Cherry Tree, / Little Jack-a-Dandy\" %\r\n- a line of text that reads: \"FREAK HANDS TROUBLESOME\" %\r\n- a line of text in German reading: \"Fangen-Finger-Fünf\" %\r\n- a text-based clipping in Scots reading: \"Thumb bold / Thibity-thold Langman,/ Lick pan, / Mammie's wee man\" %\r\n- a line of text reading: \"ILM-UL-KAFF\", which refers to the study of hand-reading %\r\n- a line of text reading: \"and now Learned Hand\" %\r\n- a short text-based clipping reading: \"Tom Thumbkin,/ Willie Wilkin,/ Long Daniel,/ Betty Bodkin,/ And Little Dick” %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a small animal resisting being pulled by a leash across a tiled floor.

The person’s hands are clasped behind their head, and the hands are the focus on the clipping %\r\n- a blurry cropped black and white photograph of hand that is slack at the wrist. A ring is visible on the person’s ring finger %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a hand and forearm reaching forward. The person’s thumb, index, and middle finger are also extended out, while the ring and pinkie finger are curled into the palm %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a person’s hand resting on their bare thigh %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a hand inside a baseball glove. The gloved hand may be resting on the person’s bare thigh, but due to the tight cropping of the clipping, it is difficult to tell for sure %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a large statue’s forearm and hand. The palm is turned up and the fingers are spread wide. In the photograph, a real person’s hand is wrapped around the statue’s forearm. No other part of the person is visible in the photograph %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a statue’s hand. The index finger of the hand is extended upwards, as is the thumb, but the middle, ring, and pinkie finger are bent into the palm.

They appear to be wearing a ring on their ring finger %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a person’s neck and shoulder with a second person’s hand resting on the first person’s shoulder. The image has been cropped so that nothing more of either person is visible in the clipping %\r\n- a colour photograph of a raised hand photographed against a black background. The palm is facing the camera and all five fingers are stretched wide. A black gathered sleeve is also visible at the bottom of the photograph %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a small hand and a lace-trimmed sleeve extending through a small hole in an oval-shaped object %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two small metallic hands that may be part of a clasp or other ornamentation on a larger object that has been cropped out of the photograph %\r\n- a detail from a black and white reproduction of a painting showing a hand resting on a flat surface %\r\n- a black and white photograph of an ornate sculpted hand and forearm.

"Page_desc":"This page contains a mix of black and white and colour clippings and is predominantly visual. Several of the clippings on the page deal with bathing, water, and/or bathtubs. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large black and white photograph of |Alberto Giacometti [499]|, in which two of his sculptures are visible in the background. Morgan has annotated the clipping with Giacometti's name in the upper right corner %\n- a black and white photograph of |Charlie Chaplin [498]| lying in a bathtub full of water while fully clothed and reading a newspaper %\n- three clipped sections from |Elliot O'Donnell's [497]| short story \"'--House,' Near Blythswood Square, Glasgow. The Haunted Bath.\" The excerpted clippings recount ghostly activity around a bath. The first two clippings read: “Then, to bring his terror to a climax, there issued from the bath a loud rubbing and splashing, as if some one, some very heavy person, was vigorously washing. The water rose and fell, squished and bubbled as it does when one is lying at full length in it, raising and lowering oneself, kicking and plunging first on one side and then on the other. Whilst, to add to the realism, Captian Smythe distinctly heard gasping and puffing; and the soft, greasy sounds of a well-soaped flannel.” To the end of this last sentence, Morgan has added in four ellipses in blue ink on the scrapbook page. The third clipping continues, reading: \"Then something, he would have given anything to tell what, came out and began to steal towards him\". To the end of this sentence, Morgan has added a colon in blue ink %\n- an original blue postage stamp from Egypt showing a crate on a hoist and the national emblem %\n- an original red 4 cent postage stamp from China showing fireworks %\n- a black and white photograph of a stone carving, captioned as: \"Plate 52 (detail from Plate 61). Ratha; projection on south face of Visnu Temple with recessed niche showing |Visnu [500]| lying on the World Serpent 'Endless'. Deogarh, U.P., c. A.D. 500.\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a line of text pasted directly below the Haunted Bath clipping, described above, which reads: \"Bulorns, Kenacks and Lizamoo\" %\n- a line of text pasted below the Bulorns text-based clipping described above. The clipping reads: \"plumb bobs with sheathes, grains of paradise, gate frames for penstocks, oil foggers, or even dehydrated kibble.\" %\n- a black and white photograph of two men in a canoe on a body of water. They are reaching down to a third man who is swimming in the water %\n- a black and white photograph taken from above a crowd of people. The crowd is walking underneath a sign that reads \"Baths\" %\n- an original black and white photograph of a naked man with a tattoo on his arm posing in the shower. He is holding a sponge or washcloth over his genitals with one hand, while the other hand is raised to his chest %\n- a colour photograph of an iridescent spiral seashell %\n- a clipped paragraph which reads: \"Much of the woodwork of Longwood House was destroyed by white ants years ago, but the building has been repaired, and as a museum it will contain many things |Napoleon [262]| used. For example, there is his bath, an antique affair with wooden sides. They told me Napoleon spent hours in it - he used to dictate his memoirs from it.\" %\n- a black and white photograph of a man standing on a ship and holding on to the rigging of a sail. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a black and white striped shirt and dark trousers %\n- a short text-based clipping, which reads: \"|Trautmann [501]|, relaxing in his bath later, said, 'The |Queen [268]| said to me, 'Well done!', and the |Duke of Edinburgh [502]| asked me, 'What is the matter with you?’\".

Six other clippings, which are a mix of black and white and colour clippings, are arranged roughly in a line along the very top portion of the page. All clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a very large, full-page clipping titled \"|Rowlandson's [507]| Record of London Life. Society, Theatre, Commerce and Officialdom.\" The clipping includes six black and white reproductions of Rowlandson's drawings, as well as including a short article that praises Rowlandson's skill and advertises an exhibition of his work titled “The Loan Exhibition of Important Drawings by Thomas Rowlandson” at \"Messrs. Ellis and Smith's Galleries in Grafton Street, W.1” which is set to run from 6 May to 29 May. The article discusses Rowlandson’s career, including his realization that “there was little money in orthodox drawings and small portraits”, which led him to “that style of caricature and the portrayals of the humours of life which was to make him famous”. The article also mentions Rowlandson’s “association with |Rudolph Ackermann [513]| , the publisher”. The images included in this clipping are captioned as: “’The Court of Exchequer, Westminster Hall’; By Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827).

MacDonald [517]|, of Abriachan. Mr. Chisholm has lived on the lochside all his life and did not believe in the monster until to-day.

The motoring party were accompanied by two young children, and while Lady Ballie was pointing out Glen Urquhart Castle on the opposite side of the loch, one of the children asked if a black object in the water were a rock. The loch was calm and the sunshine was strong. Ultimately the object began to move and rushed through the water at a high speed, leaving a long white wash. The party left the car and made for the side of the loch to get a closer view. The wash increased and then the object disappeared. The party, Lady Maud said, were delighted to have evidence that there was a monster in the loch. The monster has been seen at this point on previous occasions, especially during the spring.” %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large black and white photograph of strange-looking creature on the back of a cart or trailer, which Morgan has annotated as \"2-ton DEVILFISH” %\r\n- in the upper right corner of the Devilfish clipping, Morgan has pasted a head shot photograph of a man wearing ornamental necklaces and a headpiece %\r\n- in the upper left corner of the Devilfish clipping, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of several people in a boat illuminating their way forward with flashlight as they travel through a cave %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man dressed in a suit, tie, and jacket.

"Page_desc":"A black and white page, which includes three clippings on the Loch Ness monster. This page also includes two clippings that show artists’ portraits of women and one photograph of Edith Sitwell. A newspaper article that extends over two clippings discusses a science experiment that resulted in the apparent manufacture of spiders from a lump of cooled lava.  The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large article from the Enquiry dated May 1950. The clipping discusses an amateur scientist named |Andrew Crosse [531]|, who \"dropped a lump of lava from Vesuvius into a solution of hydrochloric acid and silicate of potash which he electrified from a battery with the idea of making crystals of silica.\" Two weeks later, \"white nipples showed up on the lava,\" and in four days, these grew legs and emerged as small white spiders, unlike any known species. Crosse is quoted as saying he was “not a little surprised”, and states that “these spider-like creatures kept alive in the solution and still kept alive when they were taken out of it, but died as soon as they were thrust back into it”. Crosse kept some spiders under a glass case, and these are said to have lived “till the first frost which immediately killed them off”. In total, the article estimates there were a hundred of the small spiders, which ranged in size, including some so small you needed a microscope to see them. The smaller spiders are said to have had six legs, while the larger ones had eight. Crosse's experiment caused controversy and he was accused by some of being in \"league with the devil\". The experiment has never been successfully repeated, but |Michael Faraday [532]| of the Royal Society inspected the insects and confirmed the truth of the story. Faraday offered the theory that the insects \"had been fossilized in the stone and were revived by the current in the solution”. The article also offers another theory in which the creatures are thought to have “hatched out of eggs by the electric force that acted on them like an incubator\". Crosse himself offers no theory, and the article says that when |Harriet Martineau [533]| wrote to ask him about the incident, he replied “I have never dreamed of any theory to account for the appearance (of the insects). It was a matter of chance. I was looking for crystals and these appeared instead”. The clipping also includes two wood-block prints, one showing an array of scientific test tubes in front of a smoking volcano and one a decorative drawing of a crystal. Morgan has annotated this clipping with a suggestion for further reading, stating: \"see |R.T. Gould [530]|, Oddities, 1944\". %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from the Bulletin dated 30 June 1951 and titled \"Nessie is on Show Again\". The clippings states that \"two appearances by the Loch Ness monster on successive evenings were reported\". The first sighting was by \"|Robert Burrell [528]|, a fishing ghillie; |Roderick MacLean [529]|, a hotel employee; and a London chauffeur who was driving American visitors on a Scottish tour.\" Burrell reports seeing what he thought was a log on the surface of the loch. When it was about 70 yards away, however, Burrell states that “it moved off at a terrific speed in the centre of the loch and then submerged. It threw up a great wash and travelled a distance of about 500 yards in a few moments before disappearing”. The second sighting was by \"an Army officer from Fort George,\" who claims to have seen the monster while fishing and to have watched it for \"almost 20 minutes\". %\r\n- a sepia-toned reproduction of a sketch captioned as: \"'Head of a Young Woman'; by |Hugo Van der Goes [524]| (c. 1405-82). A beautiful pen and brown ink drawing (7 1/2 ins. by 5 3/8 ins.) by Hugo Van der Goes\" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a painting of a woman captioned as: \"48. Portrait de Nusch.

(Mexican, born 1899) - Animals (1941)\" %\r\n- a black and white cropped version of a photograph of |Edith Sitwell [523]| lying down on a checked floor or overlay with two carved angels standing over her. Sitwell is lying with her eyes closed, her hands at her chest, and her head on a pillow. She resembles a carved effigy for a tomb. The image is captioned as: \"Edith Sitwell, D.Litt., D.Litt., D.Litt.\" The image is annotated by Morgan as \"Siton-Beatwell photog,\" which indicates, by a crossing of names, that this photograph of Sitwell was taken by |Cecil Beaton [610]| %\r\n- a clipping that includes captioned black and white reproductions of |Urs Graf's [522]| drawings \"Dance Peasants\" and \"A Piper\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a newspaper clipping titled \"Nessy's Pa Mort\" and reads: \"|John C. MacKay [526]|, the reporter who first sent out stories about the Loch Ness Monster, died at Inverness, 7-17-52 old style. He was 84. Nessy survives however. She was 'seen' in May.\" %\r\n- a newspaper clipping that reads: \"On her first visit to Scotland, |Gypsy Rose Lee [527]| took a quick trip up to Loch Ness.

"Page_desc":"This page includes a mix of black and white and colour clippings and features two large colour reproductions of still-life paintings of fruit, which take up much of the page. Along the right side of the page, a long article discusses a new theory presented by Albert Einstein. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Vincent Van Gogh's [153]| \"Still Life with Gloves\", captioned in this clipping as: \"VINCENT VAN GOGH (1853-1890). Still Life with Gloves. (Collection of |Mr. T. Van Blaaderen [538]| )\" %\r\n- a colour reproduction of a still life, which includes a grape branch, peaches, flowers, a small brown mouse, and brown, white, and orange butterfly. The image is captioned as: \"|Jan Van Huysum [536]|. 1682-1749.\" %\r\n- a large newspaper from the Glasgow Herald dated 28 December 1949 and written by |Alistair Cooke [535]|. The article discusses |Albert Einstein's [534]| \"new cosmic theory\", which is \"a generalised theory of gravitation\" that \"attempts to interpret in one synthesis the known physical phenomena of the material world.\" The article states that the announcement of the theory was planned \"to coincide with the opening . . . of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\" It also says that Einstein himself has acknowledged that he has \"not yet found a practical way . . . to confront the results of the theory with experimental evidence.\" The article then considers how long it took for Einstein's theories of relativity and general relativity to find proof and discusses how this new theory seeks to address \"the resistance of electro-magnetism to explain itself in terms of the theory that successfully interpreted time, space, matter, energy, gravitation, and inertia.\" No comment was given by those at the American Association meeting, except to say that they would need “a little time to look into it”. In response, Cooke says that “the layman may get some idea of the length of this ‘little time’ if it is explained that whereas the equation e=mc2 produced the atomic bomb the new theory requires four equations to produce the Lord knows what”. The publication date for Einstein’s full text is said to be February and Cooke states that the questions Einstein says he has answered with this work are: \"Why are there only a few specific types of elementary particles that go to make up atoms? Why do all electrons and protons have the same charge? Why do bodies produce gravitational fields?\" Einstein is also said to be continuing on \"with his lifetime's ambition, which is to harmonise the quantum theory and the relativity theory.\"%\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a newspaper clipping that reads: \"The Moscow Literary Gazette has condemned Russian parents who give their children such names as 'Electrification' and 'Cracking Combine.' One boy was recently named 'Detector,' the writer complained.\" %\r\n- a handwritten clipping that quotes |Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau [482]| and  reads: \"Comme je demandais à Genet pourquoi il refusait de connaître Gide, il me répondit : 'On est accusé ou juge. Je n'aime pas les juges qui se penchent amouseusement vers les accusés.' J.C.\".",

The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Vincent van Gogh's [153]| \"View of Arles with Irises in Bloom\" painting, captioned as: “Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). View of the Arles with Irises in Bloom. (Collection of Mr V. W. Van Gogh) %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Lucas van Leyden's [563]| painting \"The Card Players\", captioned as: “’The Card Players’; By Lucas van Leyden (1494-1533). Signed by a later hand, Lucas van Lyden P. Shown at the R. A. Exhibition of Dutch Art, 1929. Panel.” %\r\n- a black and white portrait photograph, captioned as: \"|Sir Charles Sherrington [562]| \" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a suit, which Morgan has annotated as: \"|J.G. [564]| 1951\" (possibly Jean Genet or John Gielgud?) %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two striped kittens photographed in midair, possibly while jumping or at the moment of having been tossed in the air %\r\n- a clipping showing a facsimile of someone's signature, which possibly reads John Eiegs %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a brick wall %\r\n- a black and white cartoon drawing of three people riding on the back of a running elephant. The person riding nearest the elephant’s head is a round figure wearing glasses and holding a cane and what looks like a piece of paper. This person is straddling the elephant and is leaning forward in a charge position. The second person back is holding an umbrella over the first person, and is depicted with a turban or similar headwear. This person is slender and appears to be sitting on the back of the elephant in a squat position. The final person is holding a large rectangular object under their arm and is depicted straddling the elephant %\r\n- a black and white aerial photograph of a city, which Morgan has annotated as being Bremen %\r\n- a text-based clipping describing a procedure for cases such as \"focal epilepsy\" wherein \"it becomes necessary for the neuro-surgeon to expose a patient's cerebral cortex under local anesthesia.\" The clipping continues: \"Thus the subject comes to lie quietly on the operating table, fully conscious, while the surgeon proceeds with his task. It may be advisable to stimulate the cortex with a gentle electrical current. Such stimulation is able to activate certain areas of the cortex. In different sensory areas it causes the individual to feel a tingling in hand or foot; or he may seem to see gross lights, hear simply sounds or smell crude odours. When an electrode is applied to the motor convolution in the central region of the cortex, movement results in the opposite arm or leg or face. The jaw may move up and down, the throat may swallow, the mouth may open while the patient vocalises in a long drawn out tone. Or the eyelids may open and the two eyes turn in unison as though looking upward or across to the opposite side. As far as the patient is concerned, these movements are irresistible. When the electrode is applied, for example, to the motor area of the right hemisphere, he cannot, by the exercise of his will, prevent his left hand from moving, but he can reach over with the other hand and thus hold the moving member still. When he does this, he doubtless makes use of the motor area in the cortex of the untouched hemisphere\".",

"Page_desc":"This page features a large, full-page black and white clipping showing several photographs of the Ifé heads. A few small clippings, including one handwritten clipping and one colour photograph, are placed around this large clipping.  The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large full-page clipping from The Illustrated London News that shows 9 sepia-toned photographs of the Ifé sculpted heads. Each photograph is captioned. The captions read: \"Now cleaned and on exhibition at the British Museum: one of the most beautiful heads\"; \"Showing the scarification lines: A female Ifé head of perhaps the fourteenth century A.D. The breakage-edge is covered with patina and the breakage is therefore probably ancient\"; \"Noble and contemplative: An Ifé head in which the lip and chin perforations may have carried hair”; \"Three views of one of the most recently discovered of the Ifé bronze sculptures: a less-than-life-size head and torso. The left hand holds a ram's horn, the missing right presumably a cow's tail. The diadem and insignia throw light on the famous Olokun head\"; \"Discovered during the war years: another bronze head by the unknown masters of Ifé. Before cleaning\"; \"An Ifé portrait head of singular potency. The facial perforations sometimes contain black glass beads\"; and \"Showing the facial perforations, the scarification lines, and the head perforations which may have held a head-dress\". Also included on the clipped page is a short write-up, stating that the heads were discovered \"between 1938 and 1940\" and that they are now being displayed at the British Museum. Their exhibition is said to \"coincide with the visit to this country of |Aderemi I [566]| , the Oni of Ifé, who has lent the heads\". The article discusses one of the newer discoveries, a head and torso with a diadem, which the article says \"may cast doubt on |Dr. Frobenius's [567]| identification of the celebrated Olokun head with a sea-goddess\". The article concludes by saying that \"A topical interest is added by the current exhibition of a modern Nigerian sculptor, |Mr. Ben Enwonwu [568]|\". Under the first article segment, Morgan has written a note \"see 258\", referring to a page in Morgan’s Scrapbook 1 and his inclusion of an earlier clipping on the subject of the Ifé heads. %\r\n- a black and white portrait photograph of a man in a suit clipped from a newspaper, which Morgan has annotated as \"JG\" (|John Gielgud [570]| ) %\r\n- a handwritten clipping on blue tinted paper that reads: “In the socalled ‘fireworms’ of Bermuda the meeting of the sexes involves the exchange of light signals. The worms come to the surface to spawn each month a few days after the full moon at about an hour after sunset. The female appears first & circles about, emitting at intervals a greenish phosphorescent glow which is readily visible to observers on the beach. The smaller male then darts rapidly toward the female, emitting flashes of light as it goes. When the two sexes come close together, they burst, shedding the sex cells into the sea water. Then the spent worms, reduced to shreds of tissue, perish. It has been suggested that the phosphorescent flashes of spawning polychetis were the lights seen by |Columbus [924]| on the night he approached the New World. |R. Buchsbaum [569]| 1948” %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- near the center of the full-page clipping, Morgan has pasted a cropped black and white photograph of a young man's face. The man has a white cigarette dangling from his lips and he is staring straight into the camera without smiling. %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a shirtless man photographed from the shoulders up.

"Page_desc":"This page is largely comprised of black and white clippings, with the exception of two small colour clippings near the center of the page. Several of the clippings on this page are photographic or painted portraits of men. This page also features a large text-based clipping of an article that discusses the difficulties in obtaining accurate records of longevity for the lives of animals. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large newspaper clipping written by |Dr. Maurice Burton [577]|, which discusses longevity records for various animals. Burton considers some of the many factors, including captivity, that can impact longevity and, in turn, our understanding of an animal's full potential longevity. However, he refutes claims such as \"the belief that the large tortoises live to 500 years of age\" and that Indian elephants and blue whales can live up to 200 years. The article concludes by stating that \"attention may be drawn to the obvious difficulties of obtaining reliable information on longevity in all but captive and domesticated animals. There is, however, one exception, namely, the fishes, for the scales of many species living in the temperate zones show rings of annual growth, as in cross-sections of the trunks of trees, and similar rings are found in the otoliths\". The article includes a sepia-toned photograph of several otoliths, with a caption reading: \"One of the few accurate means of determining the age of an animal: Otoliths (bony concretions in the inner ear) of the hake, with annual zones of growth clearly marked. In his article on this page, Dr. Burton reveals the difficulty of arriving at an accurate knowledge of the life-span of animals. Fishes, however, are among the few animals whose age can be read. This is done by means of the annual growth rings on the scales or otoliths, bony concretions which are found in the inner ear. Both of these are, however, unreliable after about nine years, as at this age the annual zones become narrower and difficult to define. Photograph courtesy of |Dr. C. F. Hickling [571]| \" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a painting, captioned as: \"Supposed self-portrait of |Richard Parkes Bonington [573]| \" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of dancer |Vaslav Nijinsky [574]| in a suit. He is photographed from the thighs up and is looking directly into the camera without smiling. The photograph is captioned as: \"Nijinsky. K. A.

The image is captioned as: \"Meet Grandpa. This is the oldest koala at Lone Pine. He was born in 1928 and spends most of his time sleeping\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a suit standing in front of a curtain with a microphone, which Morgan has annotated as: \"|O.W.

Both people are looking out the car windows and are smiling %\r\n- a small cropped colour photograph that is difficult to make out. The clipping is red and silver and mostly likely being used for decorative and fill purposes %\r\n- a small black and white photograph of a shirtless man sitting in a chair by water reading %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two men.

"Page_desc":"This largely black and white page focuses on photographic and painted portraits. In particular, the page features several photographic portraits taken by the photographer Nadar and also includes an article clipping about him. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a clipped article from Lilliput magazine by |T. W. Earp [607]| titled “The Photographic Work of Nadar with a Commentary by T. W. Earp”. The clipping which discusses the life and work of  |Nadar [301]| and reads: \"Nadar was the pseudonym of Gaspard Félix Tournachon, artist, journalist, and aeronaut, but now best known as a pioneer of photography. He was born in 1820 in Paris, where his father was a publisher and printer, whose Royalist sympathies contributed to the failure of his business in a period that vibrated with revolution. He could no longer support his son as a medical student at Lyons, and Nadar, compelled to abandon his career, came to Paris, like one of his friend |Balzac’s [598]| heroes, in search of a fortune. He lived a penurious life in the Latin Quarter, and took part, on the Republican side, in the Revolution of 1848. He studied painting and tried to write novels, but for an immediate living turned out caricatures and humorous articles under the name of Nadar. His facility gained him a minor reputation without easing a recurrent financial stress. On one such occasion, a friend to whom he applied for a further loan refused cash assistance, but provided him instead with a second-hand camera. His days in the Latin Quarter stood him in especially good stead when he wanted sittings from celebrities in literature and arts. His expansive geniality helped him with the others. But outside his profession, Nadar was also a well-known figure of the boulevards as an intrepid aeronaut—a hobby which did useful advertising for his camera. After successful ascents in smaller balloons, on which his photographic apparatus always accompanied him, he built ‘The Giant.’ This largest balloon of its day contained 6,000 cubic metres of gas, and on one ascent accommodated 45 artillerymen on its two decks. On account of his aerial adventures, |Jules Verne [599]| used him as his model for the hero of A Journey to the Moon, and during the Siege of Paris he was made commander of a balloonists' company. The money he lost on balloons he could aways regain by photography. During the Paris Commune he was on the side of the insurgents, but escaped the repression that followed the triumph of the Versailles Government. He lived on until 1910, honoured as the survivor of a romantic past and as the chief sponser of the camera’s coming-of-age\" %\r\n- next to the Nadar article, and likely from the same Lilliput magazine, Morgan has included a clipping which reproduces four photographs by Nadar, each of them captioned. The captions read: \"|George Sand [596]|, whose novels changed from love-stories to social propaganda\"; \"|Wagner [597]|, in the days of his unacknowledged genius, one of Nadar's first works\"; \"The novelist |Flaubert [600]|, himself a master of photographic realism in prose\"; and \"|Rossini [601]|, when the veteran composer had almost resigned from musical activity\". %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Jean Courbet's [703]| 1855 painted portrait of |Charles Baudelaire [164]| , which depicts Baudelaire seated and reading a book. Morgan has annotated the clipping as “Baudelaire by Courbet 1855” %\r\n- a photograph of |Jules Verne [599]| by Nadar, captioned as: \"JULES VERNE (1828-1905), photographed by Nadar. Nadar, an amateur aeronaut as well as one of the greatest of 19th-century cameramen, was the original of Michel Ardan\". Ardan is the protagonist from Verne’s A Journey to the Moon. %\r\n- the clipping of Courbet's painting and the clipping of Verne's photograph overlap onto the top of a large black and white photograph of Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire is photographed seated in a chair with one hand resting near his face. He is wearing a large dark coat or cloak that obscures much of his body. He is looking towards the camera and is not smiling. The photograph is captioned as: \"MAN OF LETTERS.—Nadar was intimate with many of the literary figures of nineteenth-century Paris. This portrait of Baudelaire, whose biography he wrote, was taken in 1859, two years after the publication of Fleurs de Mal\". %\r\n- two separate black and white photographs of Baudelaire, both of which Morgan has annotated with the initials \"CB\". Both clippings have been pasted onto the large portrait of Baudelaire by Nadar, one along the right edge of the large clipping and one in the lower left corner. In both clippings, Baudelaire is staring directly into the camera and is not smiling. He is wearing a large cravat in both clippings and is photographed from the shoulders up in both. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |Albert Einstein [534]| , which Morgan has annotated with the initials \"AE\" %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Peter Christus's [604]| \"Portrait of a Young Woman\" painting, captioned as: \"'Portrait of a Young Woman': By Peter Christus (D. 1472). (Berlin Museum; Wood, 28 by 21 CM.) About this painter |Professor Leo van Puyvelde [606]| writes: 'He is said to be in the direct line of |John van Eyck [605]| , but he is just as much a descendant of the Master of Flémalle, |Roger van de Weyden [552]| , or |Dirk Bouts [551]| .... His style reveals a simple and diffident soul and a penetrating and analytical mind .... His colour is extremely vigorous, and deep wine-reds are always to be found in his pictures. His personages are generally squat, with small round heads and ears set well back, and hands that are small and podgy.'\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man with a pair of goggles on his head. The man is photographed from the shoulders up. He is looking slightly up and to the right and is not smiling %\r\n- a small original black and white photograph of a shirtless man photographed from the chest up. This clipping has been pasted in to the upper right corner of the large portrait of large captioned Baudelaire photograph described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a suit photographed from the shoulders up with his head tilted back and a slightly blank expression on his face.

"Page_desc":"This page is largely black and white, except for two small colour clippings. This page features a large clipping with two black and white photographs of Kilimanjaro, as well as a reproduction of a map and a brief write-up. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large clipping that includes two black and white photographs of Kilimanjaro and a reproduction of a map, all captioned, as well as a short segment from an article. The captions for the photographs read: \"Kibo from E.N.-E., showing the erosion of the glaciers and, on the right, the inner crater area. On the left (southern) rim is Kilimanjaro's highest point, Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze (19,565 ft.). In the background, circled by clouds, can be seen the summit of Mount Meru (14,979 ft.), 45 miles to the west of Kilimanjaro. (photograph: No. 803 Squadron, R.N.A.S.)\" and \"Kibo from S.S.-W.: Note the absence of ice in the crater area, and the eroded glaciers on the right. (Photograph: No. 803 Squadron, R.N.A.S.)\". The map is captioned as: \"A map showing the relationship of the mountain mass of Kilimanjaro to the railway and Mount Meru, with the route taken to Kibo Peak\". In the upper left corner of the image of the map, Morgan has written \"see P. 1575\", referring to another of his scrapbook pages. The article segment discusses |Rev. Johannes Rebmann's [617]| first encounter with Kilimanjaro in 1848, including his surprise at seeing snow in Africa and his assertion that the presence of the snow and cold explained the dominant belief that evil spirits blocked access to the mountain. Rebmann’s descriptions are heavily colonial in tone and sentiment. The article segment also states that \"Kilimanjaro consists of two main peaks joined by a long saddle at an altitude of about 16,000 ft. The secondary peak, Mawenzi (17546 ft.), is an extinct volcano and geologically very much older and, consequently, more weathered than Kibo. Being virtually free of permanent snow and ice, Mawenzi ('Dark Mountain') presents a dark, jagged appearance very different from the round, ice-domed symmetry of Kibo ('Shining Mountain') (19565 ft).\" %\r\n- a Glasgow Herald newspaper clipping dated 8 December 1952 and titled \"Mammoth Tusk Found\". The clipping reads: \"Part of a mammoth tusk, dating back to at least 10,000 B.C. and measuring 2ft. in length and 4in. in diameter, has been found near the North Bedfordshire village of Harrold by two 'free-lance' archaeologists—|Miss M. A. Bennet-Clark [617]| and |Mr. B. C. S. Wilson [618]| —working on behalf of the Ministry of Works. Other discoveries, which date the site as an Iron Age ‘A’ period settlement (about 100 years B.C.) are a number of querns, or milling stones.\" %\r\n- a colour detail clipping from a reproduction of |Eitoku Kanō's [615]| \"The Hawks in the Pines 2\" painting. The detail shows a hawk standing with tree branches and possibly a mountain in the background %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- in the photograph of Kibo from E.N-E, which is part of the large clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of an older man's face into the clouds above the mountain. The man is unsmiling and Morgan has angled the clipping so that the man’s head is tilted down towards the mountaintop %\r\n- a black and white portrait photograph of a young man in a suit. He has been photographed from the shoulders up and he is looking slightly to the right. He is not smiling %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a child seated at the foot of a large Asian statue. The child is dressed in warm clothing and is looking away from the camera, but appears to be laughing %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a human eye %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a large pipe that sits on raised stilts over a body of water. The mouth of the pipe opens onto a beach and water is gushing from the pipe %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a drawing of people in fishing boats along a beach pulling up nets %\r\n- a colour photograph of a man sitting outside in a rocky area wearing a red plaid shirt, tan trousers and hiking boots. His knees are hugged in towards his chest and he is looking at something on the ground %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two men in a small space (possibly in a tent).

"Page_desc":"This black and white page features a large clipping that displays two photographs of glaciers on Kilimanjaro. Smaller clippings are arranged around this large clipping. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation, except for a black and white photograph of a curved brick wall, which has been pasted in the landscape page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large clipping that includes two black and white photographs, as well as an excerpt from an article. This clipping is from the same source as the Kibo Peak clippings on Page 1505. The photographs are captioned as: \"The fantastic 'waterfall' effect of a glacier on Kibo Peak - a result of ablation - with vertically laminated snow in the foreground. (Photograph: |E. Robson [619]| .)\" and \"An eroded ice-cliff - an example of 'nieve penitente,' caused by vertical weathering. Such fantastic shapes are common on Kilimanjaro. (Photograph: E. Robson.)\". The article excerpt discusses the initial publications of |Rev. Johannes Rebmann's [616]| reports on Kilimanjaro, and particularly his report, surprising to British individuals at the time, \"that mountains covered with perpetual snow could be found just under the Equator\". The article then discusses 1943 and 1945 expeditions to Kilimanjaro by |Lieut.-Commander P. C. Spink [620]| \"to examine the curious structure of glaciers under the influence of an equatorial sun. Such glaciers present an interesting study for the glaciologist, since, unlike those of high latitudes, they are subjected to vertical sun-rays, resulting in a vertical type of weathering, with curious and almost freak effects. 'Nieve penitente' formations are common, a good example being seen in one of the photographs above, and another fascinating effect is the lamination of snow surfaces. In places, the latter assumes the form of thin sheets of snow, like the leaves of a book, about six inches apart, up to two feet high, and extremely fragile. It is thought that this effect is caused by the combined action of sun and wind upon the frozen mass of snowfield, the crystalline parts remaining erect in this strange fashion. The steady shrinkage of the ice area of Kibo is manifest on the outer glaciers. Ablation of the smooth, firm surfaces takes the form of huge horizontal and parallel ice-steps, and this erosion can be seen clearly.\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a black and white photograph of a bulldog standing on its hind legs and looking over a wire fence %\n- a black and white photograph of a man in uniform on a large ship taken from below the level of the ship's deck %\n- a black and white photograph of a curved brick wall %\n- a black and white photograph of a man lying on his stomach while propped up on his elbows. He is wearing cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, and a plaid shirt. He is looking to the right and is smiling %\n- a black and white photograph of a man lying on his back with his eyes closed, whom appears to have a boxing glove on one hand and so may have been knocked out %\n- a black and white photograph of rocks and the lower part of a waterfall %\n- a black and white photograph of what appears to be a pillar or column %\n- a black and white photograph of two young men in an industrial indoor space leaning over a fire. One of them is hammering something and they may be engaged in blacksmith work or a similar labour.",

The devil is wrapped in a drape of fabric %\r\n- a black and white photograph of two dead agave shoots, captioned as: \"Ghosts in Love. From the barren-looking hillsides the straight, tall spikes of the agave shoot into the sky. The agave is a beautiful and useful plant. It takes many years, at times a century, to bloom.

"Page_desc":"This page contains a mix of black and white and colour clippings. The page features a large, full-page clipping of an article that discusses the study and recording of waves, which also includes a large black and white photograph. Several other clippings are arranged around this large clipping in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large, full-page clipping of a World of Science article by |N. F. Barber [631]|. The article opens with an anecdote about |Robert Louis Stevenson's [85]| father, |Thomas Stevenson [632]| , who set Robert to \"measure the height of waves on the sea and the strength of the wind, to check a simple rule about the growth of waves which the elder Stevenson had propounded\". The rest of the article goes on to discuss the study of waves by engineers and devised schemes to, for example, obtain \"power from breaking waves by guiding them to throw water into a lagoon some 10 or 15 ft. above sea-level, electrical power being generated where the enclosed water runs off through turbines\". The article continues by discussing the increasingly scientific study of waves, measuring, for example, the great distances they can travel once generated by a storm. Research by the Admiralty focuses on \"being able to forecast those times when the surf will be low enough to permit sea-going ships to be laden by small shore craft\". The article states that: \"At the Admiralty wave-recording station in Perranporth, Cornwall, are various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\", which can act as a warning for incoming danger. The article also states that: \"the most satisfactory prediction of waves and swell is based on a detailed knowledge of the storms that produce it. The wind systems over all the North Atlantic Ocean are summarised in charts issued every six hours by the Air Ministry and by the Admiralty, showing the 'fronts' or boundaries of the circulating masses of cold and warmer air which make up storms, contours of the areas of high and low barometric pressure and a large number of measurements of wind. Ships of all nationalities make these observations while on voyage and report them by wireless\". There are special ships at six positions in the North Atlantic used for monitoring weather and waves. The article reports that: \"It is curious to note that fish by their behaviour can indicate the presence of a distant storm even before the ground swell reaches them\", demonstrated, for example, by the fact that cod and haddock will avoid certain eating or resting grounds that prove to be later affected by a storm. The article includes a black and white photograph of waves breaking on a beach, captioned as: \"Swell from a mid-Atlantic storm arriving at Perranporth, North Cornwall, where the Admiralty wave-recording station has various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\". An abstract for the article is also included below the picture, which reads: \"In the 'World of Science' article on this page, Mr. N. F. Barber discusses some of the aspects of research into the movement of waves and the effect of storms on the surf which beats upon beaches some thousands of miles from the centre of the disturbance. Perranporth, whose flat and sandy beach open to the Atlantic swell has made it famous for its surf-riding, also provides the site for an Admiralty wave-recording station\". %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |George Bernard Shaw [236]| lying in bed, with the caption: \"November. Farewell, G.B.S. Literary genius of the century lies in state at Ayot St. Lawrence”. Morgan has annotated the clipping as being from 1950. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a statue of a head, captioned as: \"Head of a girl, 1932, by |Picasso [346]|\" %\r\n- a colour detail clipping from |Pieter Bruegel's [578]| \"The Triumph of Death\" painting. The detail shows an army of skeletons marching %\r\n- a colour reproduction of a drawing, captioned as: \"In a village squires and farmers play quoits. In this |Rowlandson [507]| caricature a rustic prepares to throw, men drink beer, woman waves broom\" %\r\n- a black and white portrait photograph of a young boy, which Morgan has annotated as \"'Mayerling' Rudolfth\", referring to |Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria [633]| , who died in an assumed murder-suicide known as the Mayerling Incident %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a woman, which Morgan has annotated as \"Mary Vetsera\", or |Baroness Marie Alexandrine von Vetsera [634]|, who was Rudolf's mistress and who also died, likely murdered, in the Mayorling Incident %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- the bottom right hand of the photograph of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, Morgan has pasted a line of text that reads: \"A Genteel Youth\" %\r\n- a colour photograph of a yellow, black and blue bird, which Morgan has annotated as being a hoopoe. The bird is photographed standing against a blue sky and there is green grass visible in the foreground %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a handstand with his torso bent so that his legs stretch out behind him, parallel with the floor. The image is captioned as: \"The Original Peter, a popular variety and television act\" %\r\n- a short clipping that reads: \"'Ninety Milwaukee tenants, all wearing masks, appeal for rent controls before a State legislature committee' in Madison, May 15. They said their landlords would evict them if they showed their faces. Cr Lasko\". Morgan has annotated the clipping as being from 1951 %\r\n- a black and white clipping of an acrostic of \"Bernard Shaw\" made out of the titles of Shakespeare plays %\r\n- a colour clipping of what appears to be a printer, possibly printing on ticker tape %\r\n- a small original black and white photograph of a man in a posing pouch holding onto a large ring or hula-hoop with one hand, while the other hand is outstretched. The man is looking up and much of his face is in shadow.",

"Page_desc":"This page contains a mix of black and white and colour clippings. The largest clipping on the page is an article by Cooke on the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. There are four other clippings on the page, two of which are photographs of Hiroshima after the bombing and two of which are colour reproductions of paintings by Metsu. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a large clipping of a 1948 article by |Alistair Cooke [535]| from the Glasgow Herald dated 22 September 1948. The clipping reports on \"The hundredth anniversary meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which had just ended in Washington\" and which reportedly \"found itself dogged and finally cornered by an old cliché that subtle men have spurned ever since |Samuel Butler [636]| gave it popular expression\", namely, the warning that \"man is too clever for his own good, that he suffers from the moral indigestion of his own discoveries\". The article continues, stating that man is a \"paranoid Prometheus whose cunning and strength have been exclusively devoted to releasing the forces of his own damnation\". The article considers presentations across a range of subjects taken up at the meeting. The article's first section heading is \"Mastery of Nature\", in which Cooke discusses a trend away from \"enchantment with the mechanical world\" into \"skepticism about the world of super-explosive energy\", or what he calls a “Disappointment in |Sir Isaac Newton [637]| . The section discusses issues such as \"Mesons, alpha particles, heavy water, isotopes, genes and hormones, the control of communicable diseases\". Other headings include \"Without Boundaries\", which discusses both the unifying force of science, and the fact that humans are surpassing their resources for the fulfillment of basic needs, and \"'Menaces' to Survival\", which discusses the \"two 'menaces' to mankind's survival\" as being \"the modern conquest of disease and the plans to redistribute industrial populations without regard to their population potential\". Also critiqued here is home industry and the gap between \"useful findings and their general application\" in the building of homes. Another heading, \"Atomic Space Ships\", discusses \"space ships propelled outside the pull of gravity by atomic energy\", although the problem of waste heat currently impedes that plan, and warnings from the United States Atomic Energy Commission that \"if atomic scientists continue to be made the butts of 'un-American smears' the United States might find itself without enough of them to keep its lead in essential atomic research and in the further refinement and stockpiling of the atom bomb\". Finally, under the heading \"Politicians' Maturity\", |Dr. Carl Sulzberger's [647]| critique of diplomats in his address to the UN is reported, which took place on the same day as the Association's meeting. Sulzberger is quoted as describing the diplomats as \"a group of children, aged about three and four, trying to break one another's toys or squabbling to get closer to the ice-cream dish without a thought of one another\". This section concludes with a quotation from |Dr. Sigmund Freud [428]|, which reads: \"The internal-combustion engine utilises, I believe, about 19 per cent of its available energy. The human being utilises rather less, if by energy is understood the ability to do all the work he is healthily able, to love and be loved effectively, and to work amiably and creatively with his fellow-men\". Other people mentioned in the clipping: |Thomas Malthas [638]| , |Dr. Samuel Smiles [639]| , |Professort Shanley Cain [640]| , |Dr. Fairfield Osborn [641]| , |Dr. Warren Thompson [642]| , |Mr Livingston Houson [643]| , |Dr. Eugene Wigner [644]| , |David Lilienthal [645]| , |President Truman [646]| , and |Charles Darwin [648]| %\n- a captioned colour reproduction of |Gabriël Metsu's [649]| \"The Letter Reader\" (or \"Woman Reading a Letter\") painting %\n- a captioned colour reproduction of Metsu's \"The Letter Writer\" (or \"Man Writing A Letter\") painting %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- two separate black and white photographs of Hiroshima taken after the bomb dropped, both of which Morgan has annotated with the word \"Hiroshima\". The photographs show the twisted metal, debris, and destruction left behind after the blast.",

The clipping states: \"Fighting-cocks were probably known in Britain before the Romans brought the sport from the East, where it had long been practiced. |Henry VIII [405]| was one of its many Royal patrons, and a cockpit was built in his palace at Whitehall. Cock-fighting often took place in schools, the masters arranging the fights and taking all dead birds; parents were expected to provide the cocks or 'Cock-pence' for the scholars. Great care was taken in feeding cocks and the expression 'to live like fighting cocks' has survived a barbarous sport forbidden in Great Britain since 1849.\" %\r\n- a large black and white photograph taken in a cave, captioned as: \"17. The STALAGMITE known as the Speaker's Mace in Cox's Cave, Cheddar, Somerset, England, and other stalagmites and STALACTITES; the formations are also seen reflected in a pool on the floor of the cave\" %\r\n- a cropped colour photograph showing several American football players.

The clippings are arranged in both portrait and landscape page orientations. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Lucas van Leyden's [563]| \"Chess Players\" painting, captioned as: \"Chess Players (below), by Lucas van Leyden of Flanders, a domestic scene painted in early 16th Century, shows members of wealthy merchant families playing or giving advice in a chess game\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a stone mural of fishes, which was found in the Mastaba, or tomb, of |Mereruka [665]| . The mural is captioned as: \"A magnificent representation of the fish fauna of the Nile, comprising as many as thirteen species. Whilst the relative sizes of the different kinds of fish are not correct, their shapes and diagnostic features are often quite unmistakable. Note, for instance, the mormyr (Oxyrynchus of the Ancients) just above the end of the boat, with its long and down-curved snout, or the Tilapia with its splendid dorsal fin. The most interesting is a cat-fish (fourth from bottom along right-hand margin), a type called Shal Batn Soda by the Egyptians - the shal with the black belly. It has the habit of swimming belly-up, and is shown in this position\". Morgan has annotated the clipping with the date \"c2400 BC\" %\r\n- a colour reproduction of the painting \"A Match at Hambledon, 1777\" %\r\n- a text-based clipping from the Bulletin dated 10 February 1953, which reads: \"The 80-ton motor vessel Holchu was towed into Colombo Harbour, Ceylon, last night by the British cargo ship Ranie, bringing with it another Marie Celeste mystery. Three days ago the British troopship Empire Woodrush spotted the Holchu drifting between Singapore and Colombo. Although completely seaworthy and with a stout lifeboat, the ship was completely deserted. The Empire Windrush radioed the discovery. The ship had ample fuel, water, and food supplies. Her cargo of tea, tobacco, and soap was intact. A broken mast is the only clue to the fate of the crew, who, it is thought, were swept overboard in a storm\". %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a human eye %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a boy in a suit and tie. The boy is photographed from the chest up. He is turned slightly to the right and he is looking slightly down. He is smiling %\r\n- a text-based clipping describing the “A Match at Hambledon, 1777” painting described above. The clipping reads: \"A Match at Hambledon, 1777. (The Cradles of Cricket.) Until about 1791 the famous old Hambledon Club usually played on Broadhalfpenny or Windmill Downs. At a club match in 1775 'it was observed, at a critical point of the game, that the ball passed three times between Mr. Small's two stumps without knocking off the bail.' This incident led to the addition of a third stump, and 'length' bowling which was gaining favour at this time, soon made it necessary to increase the height of the wickets\". ",

"Page_desc":"Much of this page is taken up by a large, full-page black and white clipping focusing on photographs that show the curvature of the earth. Four other clippings, one of which is a colour reproduction of a painting, fill up the space along the top of the page that the large clipping does not fill. Morgan has also pasted two additional text-based clippings onto the large clipping.  The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a colour reproduction of |Charles Loraine Smith's [669]| engraving \"Loss of the Chaplain\" %\n- a blue ink doodle on the scrapbook page drawn by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a text-based clipping explaining the context of \"Loss of the Chaplain\" painting described above. The clipping reads: \"Loss of the Chaplain. The greatest misfortune that can happen to a Club of Fox-hunters, respectfully dedicated to the Humane Society. Painted by C. Loraine Smith. Published 1826. In 'Scenes with the Smoking Hunt' the artist caricatured the habit of smoking while hunting. The scene is in the Quorn country, and |Parson Bennett [951]| is being dragged out of a brook. The picture recalls the story of a famous huntsman, |Dick Knight [670]|, who in jumping over a brook into which the parson had fallen said, 'Never mind him: this is only Friday and he won't be wanted until Sunday.'\" %\n- a large, full-page, black and white clipping that shows three captioned images of the earth taken from rockets, as well as a brief write-up below the photographs. The write-up reads: \"In previous issues (November 2 and 30, 1946, and March 29, 1947) we have published several photographs of the earth taken at great altitudes by cameras mounted in the heads of rockets of the V 2 type. Here we show remarkable examples recently secured at the White Sands rocket base headquarters in New Mexico. At the top and bottom of the page we show two mosaics - panoramas made by joining a series of exposures - the upper taken from a German V 2 rocket at a height of approximately 60 miles; and the lower from a U.S. Aerobee rocket at 57 miles. The large picture in the center is an enlarged section from the upper mosaic and gives some idea of the detail which can be secured. On comparison with the atlas, the upper mosaic is found to reveal the panorama (looking westward) of an arc which starts in Mexico, passes through Lordsburg and Albuquerque, and ends in the Sangre de Cristo Mts. The lower, a more vertical view, lies a little to the east and interestingly shows the launching site of the rocket and also that of the first atomic tests\". The photographs' captions read: \"The curve of the earth revealed in a mosaic of photographs taken from a V 2 rocket 60 miles up\", \"A detail from the Global Air Survey photograph above. This enlarged section is taken from round about the Figure (1), showing the Northern parts of Mexico and looking westward towards the Gulf of California\", and \"From Mexico to Wyoming in a single view: An aerial mosaic from an Aerobee rocket 57 miles up\". A numbered legend that corresponds to numbers superimposed onto the image provides a list of the places that can be seen in the aerial mosaic photograph. %\n- a text-based clipping that Morgan has pasted onto the large detail photograph of the earth from space in the clipping described above. The text clipping reads: \"'These religionists who believe in the second coming of the Lord - which direction is the Lord coming from? If the earth is a ball the heavens would be wrapped around the ball, and every direction would be up. And again, how could the Lord and his crowd hop on with the earth going hell west and crooked through space?'\" %\n- a text-based clipping that Morgan has pasted onto the large detail photograph of the earth from space in the clipping described above. The text clipping reads: \"Although they have seen rocket photographs showing the curve in the earth's surface, members of the 'Christian Catholic Church' sect at Zion, Illinois, are still convinced that the earth is flat. The photographs taken from an altitude of 57 miles over the White Sands proving grounds in New Mexico this week, were waved aside by the overseer of the sect, |Mr. M. J. Mintern [671]| , when a reporter produced them. 'When you have something really worth while in the way of proof that the earth is spherical let me know,' he said.\" %\n- a black and white photograph of a man taken from above. The photograph is possibly from a stage or dance performance. The man is wearing a hat, striped sweater, and trousers. His hands are held up beside his head. Due to the nature of the lighting, the man is casting three shadows on the floor below him. %\n- a black and white photograph of a lemur. ",

"Page_desc":"The center of this page is taken up by a large, almost full-page clipping that includes three sepia-toned photographs of the Mappa Mundi, as well as a writeup about the map. Smaller clippings are arranged above and below this large clipping. The page contains a mix of black and white and colour clippings.  The clippings are arranged in both portrait and landscape page orientations. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large, almost full-page, sepia-toned clipping that contains a photograph of a full Mappa Mundi and two detail photographs of the map, as well as a brief write-up describing the map. The collective caption for the images reads: \"Recently cleaned and repaired: the Mappa Mundi, or World Map, dating from circa 1290. (Bottom left) Detail of the British Isles, which appear on the circumference in the lower left corner. (Bottom, right) Detail of the Island of Paradise, which appear on the circumference in the top centre. (Dimensions approx. 64 in. high by 56 in. wide.)”. The longer write-up states that map was \"drawn by, or for, |Richard of Haldingham [672]| ...probably about the year 1290\" and was preserved in Hereford Cathedral. The article also states that the map was \"cleaned and repaired . . . under the supervision of the Map Room of the British Museum\". The map is described as being \"centered on Jerusalem, with the east at the head, where Paradise is shown as an island. The centre of the lower half is occupied by the Mediterranean, which runs to the left of the Black Sea. The British Isles, on the circumference in the lower left corner, in part embody twelfth-century names. The map contains numerous drawings of men and creatures, often mythical, which figure in the works of the Latin cosmographers, and details have been added from Biblical history. The basis is probably a Roman map of the fourth, or perhaps the first, century.\" The map is also compared in the article to the \"Ebstorf map of c. 1235, which was preserved at Hanover before the war. Portions of this map had been lost, and its present location is not known\" %\r\n- a black and white headshot photograph of |Marlene Dietrich [361]|, which Morgan has annotated with the initials \"M.D.\". Marlene is wearing a beret-style hat. The photograph is taken head-on, but Marlene’s eyes are looking upwards. %\r\n- a short text-based clipping titled \"Hush!!! Hush!!!\", which reads: \"Afternoon of May 15, two Chatsworth, Calif., school boys were walking home when a 'burst of machine gun slugs' began pelting the road and fields all around them. They heard no explosion and saw no plane, but they picked up some of the slugs - such as are used in nose-guns of jet fighters. 'A joint investigation by the police, Air Force and Navy failed today to find the source - etc. 'O-oh, say, can you see? By the dawn's early light!'\". Morgan has annotated this clipping with \"FSM 34\" in the upper left corner and \"1951\" in the lower right corner. %\r\n- a colour reproduction of the lithograph \"The Battle Between |Cribb [674]| and |Molineaux [675]| \" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a brief writeup contextualizing the “The Battle Between Cribb and Molineaux” described above. The writeup states: \"The Battle between Cribb and Molineaux. After |Rowlandson [507]| . Published 1811. In this famous fight at Thistleton Gap, Tom Cribb (an early champion) vanquished the negro Molineaux for the second time. Prize-fighting was at this time at the height of its popularity, and although boxing-gloves were used for sparring practice and for teaching purposes, all important contests were decided with the bare fists. Tom Cribb was the first pugilist to undergo the rigorous training which is considered so important a preliminary of the boxing contests of to-day\" %\r\n- a sepia-toned photograph of a group of people sitting outside in a mountainous landscape. The photograph is taken some distance from the group of people, so their facial features are not discernible. There is some snow on the ground amidst tufts of grass and the sky looks misty %\r\n- a cropped colour photograph of an American football player. The clipping has been cut into a triangle shape and only the football player’s face and helmet are included in the clipping. The blurry details of the spectators can be seen in the background %\r\n- a text-based clipping that reads: \"But still the most sought-after advertisement by connoisseurs remains the one, elegantly and quietly printed, which the manager of the famous hotel in Colombo slipped under the glass-topped tables in the dining-room after a typhoid scare—'All Vegetables in this establishment have been washed in water specially passed by the Manager.'\"",

"Page_desc":"The bottom two-thirds of this page are taken up by a large black and white clipping about glowworms in a New Zealand cave. The clipping includes four captioned black and white photographs, as well as the article excerpt. The clipping has been pasted in the landscape page orientation and has been folded over along the bottom of the clipping to make it fit into the scrapbook. On the back of the fold, Morgan has pasted three black and white clippings, one in the portrait orientation and two in the landscape orientation. Above this large clipping, Morgan has included three smaller black and white clippings and one medium-sized colour clipping. The black and white clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation, while the colour clipping is flipped to the landscape page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- on the reverse of the fold in the large glowworm clipping described below, Morgan has pasted a cropped black and white reproduction of the |Madonna's [41]| face from |Botticelli's [152]| \"Madonna of the Pomegranate\" painting %\r\n- on the reverse of the fold in the large glowworm clipping described below, Morgan has pasted a captioned black and white newspaper photograph of |Richard Aldington [676]| %\r\n- on the reverse of the fold in the large glowworm clipping described below, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph captioned as: \"The Temple of Neptune at Paestum, southern Italy\". %\r\n- a black and white newspaper photograph of |Marlon Brando [414]| , for which Morgan has included a partial caption that reads: \"Brando\" %\r\n- a captioned colour reproduction of |Michael Ayrton's [678]| painting \"The Grandsons\".

An older boy stands behind her with one hand on the back of her chair. He holds a long, thin stick in his other hand. He is wearing white underwear or a similar covering, but is otherwise unclothed. %\r\n- a pink ink doodle drawn on the scrapbook page by |Edwin Morgan [1]| %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a line of text pasted beneath the Brando clipping described above. The clipping reads: \"Brandy Marlo\" %\r\n- a large black and white clipping, which discusses a glowworm cave in New Zealand and includes four black and white photographs, three of which have captions. The clipping is titled “Glowworms: Their bright taillights help snare insects in dark New Zealand cave\" and it describes the \"strange and lovely\" Waitomo Cave, which is home to many glowworms. The article excerpt describes ways in which the worms attract moths and midges to them through their glow. They then entangle these insects in thread and swallow them. The excerpt continues, stating that: \"After several months of glowing and eating, the worm becomes a chrysalis and later turns into a fly\". The captions describe the images as: \"Limestone shaft leads down to glowworm cave\"; \"Glowworm threads (above), each 6 inches to 2 feet long, hang like stalactites from cave ceiling. Not luminous themselves, they shine in photographer's light. Sudden light or sound makes glowworms turn lights off”; and \"Globules of Mucous enlarge threads (below). Hanging in center is later stage of worm, the chrysalis. From it will emerge the adult glowworm, a fly twice size of mosquito, which lives only long enough to lay eggs\". The uncaptioned photo shows two small worms on a rocky surface. The clipping has been folded over along its right-hand edge so that it will fit into the scrapbook %\r\n- onto the large photograph of the glowworm threads in the clipping described above, Morgan has pasted in two clippings. The first is a black and white photograph of a carved human head, which has been placed about midway up the left side of the photograph of the cave. The second clipping is a black and white photograph of a young man in a suit photographed from the chest up. The man is looking up and to the left.

This page also includes several text-based clippings, including one handwritten clipping. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a clipping with two black and white photographs of busts. The first photograph is captioned as: \"|Giuliano Dei Medici [683]|: By |Verrochio [682]|: Terra Cotta: Mellon Collection\". The second photograph is captioned as: \"|Lorenzo dei Medici [679]|: By Verrochio: Mellon Collection\". Morgan has annotated the clipping with a reference to other of his scrapbook pages, stating: \"cf 716, 1391\" %\r\n- a clipping containing two black and white reproductions of artworks. The first is captioned as: \"Above, 'The Singer', by |Keith Vaughan [681]| , from the exhibition at the Redfern Gallery\". The second is captioned as: \"Below, 'Seated Woman', a hitherto unknown drawing by |Rembrandt [687]| recently acquired by and on exhibition in the British Museum\". The caption also describes a work titled “Children”, but as Morgan has not included this work in his clipping, he has struck this part of the caption out with a line of blue ink %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of |Bronzino's [680]| \"Portrait of a Young Man\", which Morgan has annotated with the artist's name and which overlaps on top of the Vaughan clipping described above %\r\n- a newspaper clipping from the Sunday Times, dated 28 December 1952, that references the writer's dog and its observed ability to distinguish between aeroplanes and helicopters, the latter of which it \"violently protests against\". The clipping then discusses the cat of |Neville Duke [686]| , test pilot, which showed \"the ability to detect the approach of those bangs which occur when aircraft exceed the speed of sound\" well before the sound was audible to humans. The clipping concludes by stating that: \"The phenomenon is well known, I gather, to those who live near the testing areas of supersonic aircraft, and there have been many stories, hotly debated, of broken windows and displaced roof-tiles, but no humans have claimed to be able to sense the approach of what has been called this 'accumulated bubble of sound' or of the slight shock-wave which accompanies it. Duke has no theory to explain the cat's prescience\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- between the captions on the clipping that reproduces Vaughan and Rembrandt described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a skeleton in a unearthed grave %\r\n- a short text-based clipping that reads: \"What was the meaning of the expression 'janitorial services' in a Scottish Education Department circular? asks |Mr J. Hoy [684]| (Leith-Lab.) in the Commons last night. Secretary of State |James Stuart [685]| , replying, said they were 'services undertaken by those appointed to carry out functions or duties for which school janitors are responsible'\" %\r\n- a handwritten clipping that reads: \"After one hurricane fruit trees flowered + bore fruit a second time. After another storm mulberry trees blossomed + bore a second crop of fruit. Similarly, after the Charleston hurricane in September 1752 trees which were stripped of their leaves blossomed again + bore fruit in the late autumn. |F. W. Lane [827]|\". This clipping slightly overlaps on the upper left side the Vaughan clipping described above %\r\n- a large clipping that features a black and white photograph of a stone carving, as well as an article describing the site where the carving was found. The clipping is dated 29 December 1948.  The image caption reads: \"An animal in grey stone, about 4 feet high, used now as a Christian tombstone on the site excavated, but dating back to between 1500 and 1000 B.C.\" The article describes a recent English excavation expedition \"at a prehistoric site near Rezaiyyeh, in Azerbaijan\". The article reports that: \"Thanks to kindly assistance and co-operation on the part of the Iranian authorities, it was possible to obtain an excellently stratified sequence of material, mainly pottery, dating from the beginning of the third millennium until about 1,000 B.C\". The dig extended to 44 feet down, and still did not \"reach the original surface of the plain on which the site stood\". The article then describes the various strata that were uncovered: a first stratum of \"red polished ware\" dating from 3,000 BC; a second stratum of grey polished ware, \"some of it being ornamented with elaborate motifs, include the spiral, modelled in relief\", as well as \"Models of long-horned cattle and gaming pieces\"; a third stratum of \"elaborate black polished pots with grey rims and decoration of a previously unknown variety, consisting of a horizontal zone of shallow depressions, circular in shape and alternating with diagonal incisions\", as well as \"pottery of the Susa II type (about 2000 B.C in Southern Iran)\", some tombs \"equipped with pottery, bronzes, necklaces, and beautiful obsidian arrow-heads\", and a \"smithy with iron and lead ores\"; a fourth stratum of \"undecorated but polished red or black ware, with 'beak-spouted' jars of a kind of tea-pot shape\" and a cemetery; and a fifth stratum from \"the close of the second millennium\" with material \"already well known to archaeologists from the explorations of |Sir Aurel Stein [688]| 14 years ago in the same general area\". The article concludes by stating that \"The finds, which the Iranian Government most kindly allowed to be kept together (an act facilitating to the highest degree the study of ancient Azerbaijan), will, it is hoped, be on exhibition at Oxford early next year\".",

"Page_desc":"This page is focused on a large captioned colour reproduction of Mantegna’s “The Adoration of the Shepherds” painting. Several other image-based clippings, including a colour collage by Morgan, frame this clipping along the top and left side. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Andrea Mantegna's [689]| The Adoration of the Shepherds painting, captioned as: \"Christmas in a Fifteenth-Century Masterpiece. 'The Adoration of the Shepherds'; by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506). The splendid 'Adoration of the Shepherds,' detail of which we reproduce on this page, was unknown to modern critics until, in 1882, it was shown at an exhibition at the Royal Academy. In 1932 it was presented anonymously to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It belongs to Andrew Mantegna's early period, and in its clear, enamel-like surface and precise yet nervous, springy line, presents a marked difference from his broad late style\". The clipping depicts |Mary [41]| , baby |Jesus [28]| , and the shepherds in an almost surrealist outdoor landscape. Several cherubs surround the baby Jesus. %\r\n- a black and white photograph, captioned as: \"The head-end of an earthworm showing the mouth (indicated by an arrow) and the typically segmented body. Note the absence of special sense organs. (Photograph by |A. Harold Bastin [690]| )\" %\r\n- a colour photograph of a large red plant from the National Geographic magazine, captioned as: \"'Buy your tickets to see Rafflesia Arnoldi, 40-inch giant among jungle flowers'\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- two black and white headshots of men, one pasted on either side of the caption for the Mantegna clipping described above. In both clippings, the men are looking to the side, and Morgan has positioned them so the man looking to the left is on the right side of the clipping, and the man looking to the right is on the left side, so that the men are looking in the direction of the caption. Both men are shirtless and are photographed from the shoulders up. Neither are smiling. %\r\n- a short text-based clipping that has been pasted onto the Mantegna clipping described above. The clipping has been pasted just above the clipping of the man looking to the right, also described above, and it reads: \"Even a hole in an Allen Solly sock has a distinctive look of its very own\". %\r\n- a yellow-tinted black and white photograph of two men who are outside. One man is balancing on his hands and feet in a full-wheel position with his torso facing up, and the other man is doing a handstand on the first man's stomach %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a young man in a suit swinging by his hands from a rope with a surprised look on his face %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of two young boys. One boy is looking down at something he is holding in his hands, although it is not visible to the camera. The other boy is looking at the first boy. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a richly carved archway or doorway. The carving displays many figures and patterns, including two human figures that appear to be in an embrace in the middle of the arch. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man's face in profile. The man is photographed from the neck up, and he is looking to the right. He is not smiling. %\r\n- a black and white newspaper photograph of a young man in a suit. The man has his mouth open and appears to be in the middle of saying something. He is photographed from the chest up and is looking to the right. %\r\n- a small original black and white photograph of two men wrestling. The men are wearing small briefs, but are otherwise unclothed. One man is lying on the ground while the other man stands over him. The standing man has the other man’s leg and arm lifted up in a hold. This clipping overlaps on the bottom of the newspaper clipping of the man in the suit described above. %\r\n- in the lower right corner of the National Geographic clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a colour photograph of a man in a grey suit who is looking behind a yellow curtain. He is pulling the curtain back and is positioned to make it appear as though he is peeking at the Rafflesia Arnoldi.",

"Page_desc":"This page is comprised largely of black and white clippings, except for one small colour clipping near the center of the page. This page is almost wholly visual and there are several photographs and paintings of people on this page. A large bar chart showing human diseases and disabilities takes up much of the lower third of the page. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |Alfred Kinsey [435]| , beneath which Morgan has written \"KINSE(X)Y\" on the scrapbook page. Kinsey is photographed from the neck up, he is looking up and to the left and he is smiling %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |Colette [692]| and |Jean Cocteau [482]| sitting across from each other at a desk.

Morgan has annotated the clipping as \"Carpaccio: Funeral of St Jerome / St Jerome bringing his Lion to the Monastery!!\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of |Sigmund Freud [428]| and his mother, |Amalia Freud [692]|. Freud is dressed in a suit with a waistcoat and is standing in front of a large desk. Amalia is dressed in a large hoop skirt and is seated. She is holding a book in one hand. Neither of them are smiling. The photograph is captioned as: \"Mother and Son: Freud's mother was a gay, alert young woman married to a man twenty years her senior. One of her son's basic theories seeks to explain how character is moulded by the child's attitude to its parents\". Morgan has added an annotation reading \"cf p. 1788\", referring to another of his scrapbook pages. %\r\n- a black and white horizontal bar chart from the Scientific American Journal dated January 1949. The chart’s x-axis extends backwards from 1949 through the stone age to one million years prior. The y-axis contains the names of several diseases and disabilities, including: acromegaly, congenital defects, achondroplasia, clubfoot, cleft palate, spina bifida, perforate sternum, dental decay, mineral imbalance, arteriosclerosis, arthritis, osteoporosis, rickets, fractures, bones, skull, skeleton, micocephaly, hydrocephaly, Paget's disease, syphilis, trephining, and tuberculosis. The chart is captioned as: \"Known antiquity of human diseases and disabilities is depicted in this chart. Specific conditions are listed in the column at the left. Horizontal bars show age of evidence indicating each condition. While sections in some bars indicate age of less reliable evidence. Scale changes to the right of the vertical gray bar\". %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a white collared shirt sitting in a chair with no trousers on. He looks to be putting on a sock, or possibly a shoe. He is looking to the left and is smiling. Behind him are two sets of shelves with various objects on them, including a stack of books %\r\n- an original black and white photograph of a man in a small bathing suit or underwear. He is photographed from the thighs up, and he is posing with one arm bent at the elbow and flexed in front of him. He is looking down and to the right and is not smiling %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of a person with exaggerated makeup, including what looks to be a full face of white base makeup, flared black eyeliner, and black lipstick. They are photographed from the waist up and have one hand on their hip. They are looking to the left and are not smiling. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a shirt and tie sitting down and reading a piece of paper. He is photographed against a brick wall. %\r\n- a colour photograph of trees growing on a rock formation. The trees have leaves, but look slightly tinged with yellow and so the photograph may have been taken in the autumn. %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a person in what looks to be an early science fiction version of a space suit. The person is photographed from the ankles up. They are wearing a round helmet that completely obscures their face. They are also wearing gloves and a shirt that is made from a metallic-looking fabric. Their trousers sit high on their waist. The person is waving with their right hand. %\r\n- in the bottom right corner of the chart in the Scientific American clipping, Morgan has pasted a small, original black and white photograph of a naked man. The man is seated and is leaning back on one arm. His other arm extends in front of him and is resting on one of his knees, which is bent. His other leg extends forward on the floor in front of him. He is facing to the left and is looking ahead without smiling. ",

It reads: \"Red Deer Shooting. A Long Shot. Painted and engraved by Newton Fielding. Published 1836. The deer-forest area in the Highlands has steadily increased since the early days of the 19th century, when English sportsmen first began to rent the forests. The guns have improved since these early days, but otherwise the sport is carried on in much the same fashion. The stalking of the deer is a difficult craft requiring much practice and patience.

The clipping includes an image caption and brief writeup about the caterpillar as well. Along the bottom edge of the photograph, Morgan has pasted a second, smaller photograph of the same caterpillar, as well as a colour photograph of the head of a fish. On the large clipping, just above the smaller caterpillar clipping, Morgan has also pasted a text-based clipping about how dolphins hear.

Below the image is a write-up, which states that the caterpillar will become \"the beautiful Tiger Swallowtail butterfly, one of the commonest species of North America\". The caterpillar is described as being \"2 ins. long when fully grown, and greenish-yellow in colour. The 'eye' spots are yellow, edged with black, and the 'pupil' is blue with a black border. The true eyes are much lower down on the head, near the mouth-parts\". This colouring has been called a “’warning’ colouration” by |Dr. M. Burton [577]| . The caterpillar also has \"a pair of bright-coloured fleshy 'horns' which can be projected from a slit in the dorsal wall of the prothorax. This slit can be seen in our photograph running across the base of the large upper 'lip'. The 'horns' are like the fingers of a glove, and are turned inside-out when in the body - the inner surface becoming the outer when the horns are projected. This outer surface gives off a highly disagreeable odour which has led to these caterpillars being called 'the polecats of the Insect World.'\" The caterpillar is said to eat \"birch, poplar, wild-cherry, fruit trees and many other trees and shrubs.\" The photograph is credited to the New York Zoological Society %\r\n- onto the bottom of the caterpillar photograph in the clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a smaller photograph of the same caterpillar.

The article cites the research of |Mr. W. N. Kellogg [732]| and |Mr. Robert Kohler [733]| who \"conducted a series of experiments on this subject in a large tank at the Oceanographic Department of the University of Florida at Tallahassee. The tests were on bottle-nosed dolphins whose sound range rises from a low growl and groan-like sound to a shrill whistle which may rise to a frequency of several thousand cycles per second. These dolphins have highly developed acoustic receptor organs although they seem to be deficient in smell sense, which is surprising in creatures which obtain all their food under water.\" The experiments \"produced underwater sounds from an oscillator with a range of 20 to 200,000 cycles per second. The stimuli were in short bursts of about two or three seconds. High tones had the immediate effect of increasing the swimming speed of the creatures. Low tones disturbed them even more; they broke up their swimming formations, leapt out of the water, and at times seemed to charge the sound machine. From these experiments it is inferred that dolphins possess an upper limit of hearing much higher than that of man, perhaps reaching an upper threshold of 80,000 cycles per second\". The research also speculates that: \"The low frequencies may represent dangerous sounds such as ships' propellers or the noise of surf beating on the shore\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man squatting down in an indoor space while playing a stringed instrument that is decorated with feathers %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a series of slats that may be from a window shutter or vent of some sort %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in dark underwear posing in a seated position. His head is turned to the right and he is not smiling. His knees are bent, one along the floor and one lifted and bent towards his chest.

"Page_desc":"A largely black and white page, except for one large colour reproduction of van der Weyden’s “Portrait of a Young Woman” in the lower right corner of the page. The van der Weyden clipping is the largest clipping on the page, although a large black and white photograph of a praying mantis’s head and forelegs right above this clipping is almost as large. Near the center of the left edge of this page there is some blank space on the page that Morgan has not filled with anything, which is unusual for the scrapbook pages in this book. The clippings are mostly placed in the portrait page orientation, except for one small text-based clipping that has been flipped to the landscape orientation %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |Rogier van der Weyden's [552]| \"Portrait of a Young Woman\" %\r\n- a black and white clipping showing photographs of two stone carvings, one a relief sculpture and one a sculpture, collectively captioned as: \"Left, 'The Booted Warrior': red sandstone pillar, from Bharhut Stupa Central India (second century B.C.); right, 'Woman Writing': sandstone attributed to Bhuvaneswar, Orissa (c.

He is photographed from the thighs up and he is leaning forward on both arms toward the camera. He is looking slightly down and to the right and he has a small smile on his face %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a shoe covered with spotted fur and decorated with claws around the toe, captioned as: \"Nothing like a carnivorous shoe to emphasize feline femininity. The fur is attached to a wooden base and has a set of lion's claws\" %\r\n- a cropped black and white photograph of the back of a boy's head and shoulders. He appears to be sitting in a group with other people, as the torso and arms of at least one other person can be seen in the background %\r\n- a clipping that reads: \"In Cleveland, |Mrs. Norma Peden [740]| told a divorce court that when she asked her husband to explain a package of love letters from a nightclub entertainer, he laughed, said: 'This is a modernistic world,' and broke a mirror over her head\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a man in a suit standing with at least two other people behind him whose faces are just visible behind each of his shoulders. The man is looking to the right and his mouth is open wide. He looks as though he may be in the midst of singing %\r\n- a text-based clipping that reads: \"Not many golden eagles die a natural death, but I believe that, under favourable circumstances, their life exceeds that of a human being. We, or our successors, may in time learn more of this if the young golden eagles which are now being ringed in the eyrie are recovered in later years. When I was looking through an old newspaper-cutting book belonging to a friend, I came across a contemporary account of the shooting of a golden eagle. This bird was shot in France in the year 1845. It had a collar of gold round its neck, and on the collar the inscription was engraved: 'Caucasus patria, Fulgor nomen, |Badinski [741]| dominus mihi est 1750. (Caucasus my country, Lighting my name, Badinski my master, 1750.)' The inference is that the eagle was used in falconry (as I believe it still is in the Caucasus) and may have been taken from the eyrie and trained for this purpose. But even if the collar had been placed round the bird's neck in the first year of its life, it still would have been ninety-five years old when shot in 1845. It had travelled far from its native land, but there was nothing in the newspaper report to show that it was old or failing in health\".",

Onto this clipping and below the clipping, Morgan has added seven small image-based black and white clippings. The clippings are all in the portrait page orientation. %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a large, full-page clipping showing three greenish-tinted black and white photographs of a male seahorse carrying fertilized eggs in his pouch. The clipping includes a caption that describes these three photographs, as well as four others that appear in the scrapbook on the facing page (797). The caption reads: \"On this and the facing page we see some intimate glimpses of the life of the seahorse. Opposite is recorded a moment in the courtship of the fishes. This is quite an elaborate ceremony, the pair circling each other in the water, swimming gracefully around and around. The wooing soon nears its climax and the male and female fishes approach one another. The female transfers her eggs into the pouch of the male, and they are believed to be fertilized at this time. They remain in the pouch for about forty-five days. Lower right is a male with a pouch swollen by prospective small seahorses. One can almost imagine an unhappy look on the paternal face. Above, on this page, the male fish bumps his distended pouch on a shell, possibly with a desire to hasten the day of the ejection of the little ones. Below, through the X-ray, we see the exterior and interior skeleton of the seahorse and the shadowy pouch, and, finally, a tiny new seahorse wriggling out of its father's pouch. The young are miniatures of the adults and soon are on their own, instinctively attaching themselves to something and starting to feed. More than one female may deposit her eggs in the pouch of a single male.\" Below the caption, Morgan has written \"See 113\", referring to another of his scrapbook pages. %\r\n- to the right of the seahorse clipping caption, Morgan has pasted a small, original black and white photograph of a man in briefs. The man has been photographed against a white background and is standing with his arms at his side and with one leg slightly in front of the other. He is looking at the camera and is not smiling %\r\n- in the upper right corner of the seahorse clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph showing a multi-figured sculpture on the side of a building that is likely a church. The sculpture shows one man with his hands behind his back and two other men who appear to be attacking him. A fourth man is crouched low on the ground %\r\n- a black and white photograph of an Asian vase painted with several human figures %\r\n- a black and white reproduction of a painting that shows foliage, a small dead animal, and the feet of people. The animal is lying with its belly up and somewhat resembles a small dragon. This clipping is likely a detail image clipped from a larger work %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a mask with bulging eyes and whiskers %\r\n- a black and white aerial photograph showing a farm house with what looks to be several cone-shaped stacks of grain or a similar harvest in front of it %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a small rabbit photographed from behind.

"Page_desc":"This page features a large text writeup that discusses the ways in which scientists study fur and hair, as well as a clipping with two large black and white photographs, one of a magnified human hair and one of a horizontal section of a human scalp. This page is largely black and white, except for one colour reproduction of Constable's The Cornfield painting in the upper right corner of the page. The clippings are all in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a colour reproduction of |John Constable's [748]| The Cornfield painting %\r\n- a black and white clipping showing a section from |Ivan Albright's [749]| painting of Dorian Gray for the 1945 film. The painting has been photographed with the shadow of a hand holding a knife cast across it %\r\n- a large paragraph of text typed out on a typewriter from |Richard Hakluyt's [750]| The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, and Discoveries of The English Nation, Volume 9 Asia, Part 2. The clipping reads: “Besyde the yle of Mistorak, upon the left syde, nyghe to the ryvere of Phison, is a marveylous thing. There is a vale between the mountaynes, that durethe nyghe a 4 myle: and summen clepen it the vale enchaunted; some clepen it the vale of Develes, and some clepen it the Vale perilous. In that Vale heren men often tyme grete tempests and thondres and grete murmures and noyses, alle days and nyghtes: and gret noyse, as it were sown of tabours and of nakeres and trompes, as  thoughe it were of a gret feste.

The first lines of the clipping read: \"The best portion of a hair to study is the middle third of its length; its characteristics are all fully formed, yet not frayed or mutilated through environmental wear. The parts of a hair are an outer cuticula, a wide cortex, and a narrow central medulla. The cuticle consists of great numbers of minute, structureless, transparent, imbricated scales, the apices pointing toward the tip of the hair; the overlapping of the scales reminds one of shingles on a roof or of scales on the body of a fish. As shown by the numerous studies of |Professor L. A. Hausman [751]| , the size, pattern, and sculpturing of these scales is specific, identification of the species being generally possible from their inspection. This work has played an important role in detection of spurious fur garments. Bat hair is the most interesting of all types for its complex scales and has long been a favorite with the microscopist.\" The clipping continues, stating that the second most important part of the hair for identification is the medulla, although this feature is said not always to be present. The clipping then discusses the cortex and the ways in which pigment occurs in coloured hairs. The clipping states that pigment “may be diffused like a stain through the entire cortical substance, but is more often present in the form of definite pigment granules in either or both cortex and medulla. The cuticular scales are never coloured. The pattern of pigment granules is often diagnostic and an important aid in identification”. The clipping concludes by stating that Hausman and others are now turning their attention to the fusus, which may be the “most important of all hair characteristics for personal identification from unknown samples. As the cells of the cortex grow and change from cuboidal to fusiform, intercellular spaces filled with tissue fluid are compressed along with the cells into minute fusiform areas. When the fluid has gone, these spaces, the fusi, become filled with air and will appear black under microscopic examination because of refraction of the transmitted light. Gray hair will result from loss of pigment granules with advancing age, but white hair requires, in addition, the presence of many fusi” %\r\n- a clipping with two black and white photographs, one of a magnified hair and one of a magnified section of a human scalp. The photographs are collectively captioned as: \"Above, scales of human hair, oblique illumination, magnified 140X. At left, horizontal section of human scalp, hairs in cross section in their follicles. Magnified 80X.\" %\r\n- a black and white photograph of curtained window with a person's face visible behind the translucent curtain. This clipping overlaps on top of the upper right corner of the photograph of the magnified human hair described above %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a sculpture that shows a nude human figure seated with their hands resting on their knees. The head of the sculpture is tall and fairly large. The sculpture is carved from a dark material, perhaps wood or stone %\r\n- a faded black and white photograph of a young boy leaning against a wall with one hand in his pocket and the other by his side. He is wearing shorts and a collared t-shirt. He is looking at the camera but does not appear to be smiling.  ",

The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\nIdentified Clippings: %\n- a colour reproduction of |Joseph Turner's [269]| Crossing the Brook painting %\n- a black and white photographic postcard depicting the Antique Temple in the Sanssouci Park in Potsdam %\n- a black and white reproduction of |Agnolo Gaddi's [778]| Storie della vera croce painting, which Morgan has annotated as \"Gaddi (Agnolo) 1380\" %\n- a black and white detail from |Hugo van der Goes's [524]| The Adoration of the Kings painting from the Monforte Altar.

Secondly, there is the inexpressible confirmation of meaning. Meaning is assured. Nothing can any longer be meaningless. The question about the meaning of life is no longer there. But were it there, it would not have to be answered. You do not know how to exhibit and define the meaning of life, you have no formula or picture for it, and yet it has more certitude for you than the perceptions of your senses. What does the revealed and concealed meaning purpose with us, desire with us? It does not wish to be explained (nor are we able to do that) but only to be done by us. Thirdly, this meaning is not that of 'another life', but that of this life of ours, not one of a world 'yonder' but that of this world of ours, and it desires its confirmation in this life and in relation with this world. This meaning can be received, but not experienced; it cannot be experienced but it can be done, and this is its purpose with us\" %\n- a text-based clipping titled \"The Price of Hornlessness\", written by |John Hammond [779]| , D.Sc., F.R.S.. The clipping states that: \"The craze for selecting hornless goats has increased the percentage of intersexual or hermaphrodite animals which have usually the external appearance of a female, but in which the internal reproductive organs have been changed over in varying degrees to the male side, so that they are incapable of breeding\". The clipping cites research by |S. A. Asdell [780]| , in which three hundred intersexed animals were examined, all of which were hornless. Asdell argues that the goats started as female, but were modified in development by a recessive gene, or “chemical hereditable matter, which causes hornlessness\". The article states that: \"Something of a similar nature is known in cattle. The so-called White Heifer disease is caused by a gene which is closely linked with white colour. Almost all cases of this disease occur in white animals, although of course the great majority of white animals are perfectly normal and only a few have the gene for the disease\". The clipping continues, stating that: \"'Freemartins' or intersexes in cattle are not caused by a gene, but by the transfusing of the blood of the male in utero to the female, changing its internal sex organs over to the male side\" %\nUnidentified Clippings: %\n- a black and white photograph of a patch of snow on a rocky terrain.",

It is well known that farmers used to put slices of pork and other meats in the cider - the suggestion being that it fed the yeasts and enabled them to provide a higher content of alcohol than would otherwise be the case. In the conditions of anaerobic fermentation there was not much fear of putrefaction of the meat, although what happened to it after it disappeared, leaving only the bone, is beyond my knowledge. I think you can take it that the practice is now practically unknown. What I was in France before the War - taking a party of cider makers round the wine districts - we were asked to sample the wines from two vats, one of which contained a wine of greatly superior quality to the other. On asking the purpose of this test, we were told that in the better vat of wine they had discovered the skeleton of a baby and it was surmised that in some way this was connected with the improvement in flavour.*'\".

"Page_desc":"This page is black and white, except for one text-based clipping that is printed on blue paper. This page contains a mix of text-based and image-based clippings. The lower third of this page features a large black and white photograph of a carved pillar in front of a river or lake with a mountain in the background. The upper part of the page features a black and white clipping with three photographs showing various stone artwork found in churches and on monuments. The clippings are arranged in the portrait page orientation. %\r\nIdentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a series of panel relief carvings by |Andrea della Robbia [793]| that show the Coronation of the |Virgin Mary [41]| , |St. Francis of Assisi [182]| receiving the stigmata, |St. Jerome [695]| penitent in the desert, the Annunciation, the Nativity of |Jesus [28]| , and the Adoration of the Three Kings, which Morgan has annotated with the artist's name and with the year \"c 1460\". %\r\n- a black and white clipping that contains three photographs, captioned as: \"Fig. 426. Tutbury, First use of alabaster. c. 1160 Fig. 427. Bakewell. Monument of Sir G. Foljambe. d. 1376. Fig. 428. Youlgreave. Monument of Robert Gylbert. d. 1492\". The first photograph shows a detail from the Norman West Doorway of Tutbury Church, the second shows the monument to |Godfrey [792]| and |Avena de Foljambe [791]| at All Saints Church in Bakewell, and the last shows a Reredos depicting Mary and Child, as well as a man, a woman, and seventeen children, inscribed to |Robert [790]| and |Joan Gilbert [789]| at All Saints Church in Youlgreave %\r\n- a text-based clipping from |Gilbert Chesterton's [788]| St Francis of Assisi, which reads: \"one night the people of Assisi thought the trees and the holy house were on fire, and rushed up to extinguish the conflagration. But they found all quiet within, where St. Francis broke bread with |St. Clare [794]| at one of their rare meetings, and talked of the love of God\" %\r\nUnidentified Clippings: %\r\n- a black and white photograph of a carved pillar in front of a river or lake with a mountain in the background %\r\n- a small line of text that reads: \"the most copious and rural harmony\", likely from |Edward Lear's [29]| \"The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World\" %\r\n- a text-based clipping that is printed on blueish-gray paper, with the subtitle \"The first performance of the |Shostakovitch [786]| 129th in F in London last night was marred by four fatalities, to which reference is made elsewhere. It remains for the critic to say that they luckily had no effect on the performance of the work, which showed the East Grinstead at its versatile best\". The clipping continues, stating that: \"The death of |Bruno Xlavski [785]| is a serious loss to music. Those of us who have watched his meteoric rise since he first discarded the triangle will feel an irreparable blow. It is a fitting comment on his genius to say that he piloted the Shostakovitch 129th masterfully, to his end. The last three hours of the work showed how brilliantly the orchestra can rise to an emergency”. Other sections from the clipping read: \"Music has also lost by the death of |Smith [787]| , the Croat whose work as a sound effectist has been noticeable in a number of modern orchestras. He was particularly effective on the air raid siren.\" Referring to the new symphony, the clipping states that: \"The composer - who saw in, by the way, from Leningrad, as he abominates the English spring and would not travel - has used his whole battery of technical resource. Twelve drummers and eight sound effects men made up a massive wall of orchestral sound, through which the 32 first violins succeeded in occasionally interpolating a line of pure if reluctant melody. The symphony is divided into 28 movements of which the last six are the longest. There are thematic associations between alternate third movements, with repercussions in the undertones. There is thus a haunting effect as of an idea being systematically followed by a diminishing echo, and the critical appreciation needs tuning up to it\". The clipping concludes under the subtitle \"Gas Jet Hiss\" and reads: \"All this will need sorting out by the various Shostakovitch societies all over the world, most of whom, we think, will find it hard to accept the master's early introduction of the idea of an escaping gas jet - a noise produced by the sound effectists with the utmost stealth. It was hissed by the audience. It plays a valuable part, however, in the overtones of the dominant introductory theme, and he would be a brave man indeed who would find fault. A memorable night.\"",

A Cornish historian cites a case in the time of |Edward I [815]|, which he considers as pointing to the survival of some pagan sacrifice to the setting sun. A woman and her two daughters, convicted of larceny, were taken to Maen Escop (the old Cornish name for Bishop's Rock, the well-known Atlantic lighthouse and the most westerly point of England) with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water, and there left to be drowned by the waves of the sea. Since the old name for Scilly was Sull-ey (Sun Island), it seems to me probable that human sacrifice to the sun may have been offered there; though I should not have thought it would be specifically to the setting sun, which would surely be seen to have gone even further west.\"",

When the cider was made and the vats filled we closed the tops with wooden lids and covered them with straw. We drew off from the vats into large earthenware jugs as we wanted it. One year just about cider-making time a large white sow disappeared. Yes, it just vanished. It was the talk of Monmouthshire. We hunted all over. Everyone had a different theory to account for it, but it was never found until next year when we had emptied the big vat and came to clear it out and there we found the sow's skeleton white and clean at the bottom. She had climbed up a ramp which we had put up while we were fitting the lids, walked on the lid, it tipped up, she slid in and the lid tilted back into place without leaving a sign. But everyone had voted the cider the finest we had made in years\". Below this paragraph, Morgan has written \"cf P812\", referring to another page in this scrapbook with a similar story.",

It is a strange sight to see all the happy faces, all this gaiety against the macabre background. Then all these noisy ghosts, these demons of joy and madness, begin to move in long columns, they dash along in torrents, they turn and twist, sweeping backwards and forwards; the couples crowd together, surge on and back, without ceasing, never stopping, and the tocsin tolls, and the tum-tum of the drum rolls. The orchestra plays on, it hammers out the beat, growing louder and more insistent, and not allowing the dancers time to pause or to breathe; the volley of guns rings out at regular intervals; one hears cries, groans.

The article discusses organizations of beggars in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century London, in which there were different roles and types of beggars. The article names the men's roles as the Upright Man, who is the chief, the Ruffler, who is the Upright Man's second, Anglers, who fished through windows for sheets, Fraters, who were bogus hospital collectors, Priggers and Prancers, who stole horses, Counterfeit Cranks, who were fake epileptics, The Drummer, who doubled his tongue to make noise instead of speech, Tom of Bedlam or Abraham Man, who pretended to be mad, Jackman, who forged licenses to beg, and the Glymmer, who carried a license that said his house had been burnt down. Women to whom the Upright Man exercised \"some sort of seignorial claim\" are said to have various names, with Dells denoting virgins, Doxies denoting those who were not virgins, but were unmarried, Antem Morts denoting those who were married, and Walking Morts denoting those who were unmarried but had children. The children of Walking Morts were called Lullaby-Cheats. Thieving roles for women are listed as Bawdy-Baskets, \"who peddled haberdashery from house to house, bought coneyskins, and stole what they could\" and Kinchin Morts, who carried young babies and pricked them to make them cry in order to collect alms. The article states that both men and women could specialize in clymes, or fake sores, and reports that in \"the year 1600 there were supposed to be 12,000 beggars in London alone\". The suburbs of London are described as “the 'dark dennes'\" and \"worst places in England for beggars\". The clipping concludes by stating that: \"in the seventeenth century the beggar bands were broken up. Rogues were hauled in, branded with an R, and sent to Virginia. It was no longer safe to move in bands, the day of the individual had returned. Some of the ex-members became highwaymen, some Coney Catchers, or confidencemen. There were various forms of this. The Courtesy Man persuaded people to play cards with strangers: the Foist held his victim in charming conversation while removing his purse. He had to possess 'an eagle's eye, a lady's hand, and a lion's heart.' The Nip cut purses and let the coins drop into his hand. There were academies for Nips, where the little lads practised on figures hung with bells\" %\r\n- on the back of the fold of the beggar clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white reproduction of a painted (or perhaps drawn) profile portrait of a man. The man is shown from the shoulders up and appears to be wearing a wig that has been tied back in a ponytail. He is also wearing a cravat and a buttoned-up jacket. ",

They were a kind called Bobhowlers, and were about as large as sparrows, we usually found them in the boat house and this was the first time we had seen any dead so we held them near the candle to examine them better. Then to our horror they began to come alive, first their horried little trunks unfurled, gradualy [sic] their eyes all lit up and became bright red all glowing, then their furry bodies started to twitch and their wings to shiver but they never became completely alive, not alive enough to walk or fly, the glowing ruby eyes was the worst part of it. We hated them so much but something unhealthy compelled us to spend most of the night reserecting [sic] these dead moths, we felt kind of powerful, like God, but it was disipointing [sic] that as soon as we took them away from the candles [sic] rays they collapsed again. Eventually we went to bed and the next morning I just sicked and sicked till I'd got all the horror out of me, but Nan didn't\".

The clippings state that: \"It was not uncommon for Gypsy women, especially if they were elderly, to be buried alive. But death by hanging, even death by live burial, it was realised by the Germans, was altogether too quick and painless. By a Frankfort-on-Maine decree of 1722, it was enacted that all Gypsies were to leave the Upper Rhine area (as similar decrees were already in force throughout the German states, these people had nowhere to go), that all Gypsies found in the area after a short time were to be branded with the letters O.C., and then to be scourged, both punishments to be inflicted in public. If after this they were found again, they were to be executed either by hanging or by beheading. But if any crime other than that of being a Gypsy could be brought against them, they were first to be pinched with red-hot tongs and then broken alive on the wheel. No distinction was made between the sexes so far as these punishments were concerned, save that it was recommended that the women be more severely dealt with. A Neuburg decree of 1766 ordered that all Gypsies were to be arrested and tortured. They were, if no crime could be brought against them, to be beaten with rods and branded upon the back with a gallows, male and female alike; if a crime could be proved against them, they were to be executed. Branded Gypsies, if arrested, were to be hanged without further trial in the public street. The Neuburg decree also provided for the punishment of gorgios found associating with or helping the Gypsies. Between the years of 1700 and 1800, no fewer than 76 decrees of this sort were passed in Germany. It is not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that we find any sort of protest against these barbarities being made by a German. Then we do find one writer going to great lengths to justify them, while another admits he cannot think without discomfort of an 'old, helpless, perhaps quite innocent' Gypsy woman who had been buried alive\".",

Our visit was a blessing to us and we have reason to believe that it was also a blessing to |Miss Brown [886]| and |Miss Robel [887]| , the two brave girls stationed here. Six or eight Indians showed a desire to follow the Lord and we prayed with them. Some of them had made previous beginnings but had been pulled down by sin. Indian work needs a great deal of prayer. 'Yesterday I saw the Minister of War again and made arrangements to demonstrate to-day. The Minister, two generals, the head of the Police of Quito and a number of officers and soldiers were present. I used the 'Billy' first but I am sorry to say it did not prove a success. I shot it at two soldiers but they were able to stand the gas and get me. I then shot the grenade in a room and asked the men to go in. This was a real success and helped to gain what I had lost through the failure of the 'Billy'. '|Colonel Santor [888]| happened to be here on a visit and he witnessed the demonstration. I found out through his conversation with the Minister that he, it seemed, secured some gas grenades (larger than yours and black) through the American brewer, Yoder. This is no doubt the reason he has been putting me off. It is more than likely that he got something out of it. 'Before leaving, the Minister asked me to give him the best price on 100 'Billies' and 200 grenades. I told him I would write to you and have you send him quotations and terms direct . . . . 'I have a letter from the Reed boys telling me that they are getting in touch with you. It may be best to have them as your agents from now on but I don't think they should come in for any of this order, as I . . .' The remainder of this letter is missing-the portion above was used as evidence during an investigation into the private-trade in arms held by the Nye Committee in Washington during 1934 and 1935. Mr. Young's company sold explosives and gas to the South American republics\".",
