The photograph shows signs of wear, including a small hole worn in the middle of the photograph. Inside the front cover, a small sticker states that the book was made by R.B. Thomson Stationer, Printer and Bookbinder, 12 West Nile Street, Glasgow. The scrapbook paper is ruled with pink and blue lines (blue ruling lines running horizontally and pink margins). The pages are bound in groups and have mottled edges.",
"Scrapbook_notes":"Although Morgan gives this book that date range 1931-1953, he also notes the early materials for this book were rearranged from small blotters in 1937.",

"Scrapbook_materiality_desc":"This book has a cardboard cover, wrapped with brownish-orange material that resembles masking tape along the spine and at the opening edges. Morgan has created a collage piece on the front cover. The University of Glasgow tag, which on most of the Morgan scrapbooks is on an inside cover, appears here on the outside of the front cover below the collage. Inside, the paper is ruled paper with blue lines and the paper has started to yellow.",
"Scrapbook_notes":"The collage on the front cover consists of a large black and white aerial photograph showing a snowy mountain scene and a large body of water, over which a large flock of birds is flying. Onto this image, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of what looks to be a pile of rubble that includes several statues, a black and white detail reproduction from Niclaus of Haguenau and Matthias Gr√ºnewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which shows Mary, mother of God, in a white veil collapsing backwards into Saint John's arms, while another woman kneels with her hands held upwards and clasped in prayer, and an original black and white photograph that shows a man in hiking boots and summer outdoor wear sitting beside a large rock formation. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
