The article cites differences in genetic adaptations due to weather betweeen the two species as part of the cause of these gender transformations. The second text-based clipping discusses the effects of, respectively, increased doses and absences of thyroid on the development of tadpoles. The first diagram is captioned as: \"Fig. 13. - (A) A newt gastrula partially constricted by means of a hair. Note the two parts of the blastopore on either side of the hair. (B) Later stage.

Yellowhammers begin at a frequency of five thousand five hundred, and the grasshopper warbler soars to a frequency of eight thousand. Perhaps this is why the bird has been named 'grasshopper,' for the grasshopper itself makes a noise which no human being has ever properly heard.

The article discusses <a href='/collection/person/145'>Sir Jacob Grimm's</a> theory that the legends surrounding ladybirds and goldbeetles are \"relics of prehistoric beetle-worship\", linking these beetles to the <a href='/collection/person/41'>Virgin Mary</a> and, before her, <a href='/collection/person/146'>Freya</a>, Northern goddess of Spring and Love. The clipping quotes the English children\u2019s rhyme \u201cLadybird, ladybird, fly away home! Your house is on fire and your children will burn!\u201d. The clipping compares this English version with the Scottish variant, quoted as: \u201cKing, King Gollowa\u2019, Up your wings and fly awa\u2019: Over land and over sea, Tell me where my love can be? (Kincardineshire)\u201d.  The clipping discusses traditions around Europe connected to the ladybird, such as the Swedish belief that when a ladybird lands on a girl\u2019s hand, the direction she flies denotes \u201cwhence comes the bridegroom\u201d. In Switzerland, ladybirds are offered \u201cmilk, bread, and a silver spoon\u201d, and in Germany, a ladybird on someone\u2019s finger is asked \u201cHow long shall I live?\u2014one year, two years\u201d until the ladybird flies to its home \u201cin heaven\u201d or \u201cin the sun\u201d. The article then describes how the scarabaeus was an \u201cemblem of eternal life, self-generation, resurrection, and of the sun\u201d in ancient Egypt, and describes <a href='/collection/person/962'>Khefera</a>, an Egyptian beetle-god. In India, the Sanskrit name for ladybird was \u201cIndrag\u00f4pa (cowherd of Indra, Sun and Thunder-god)\u201d.

The article states that the traditional forms of wood-carving have survived \u201clonger in those parts of Yorubaland by reason of their seclusion from the influence of Mohammedan priest and Christian missionary, both of whom have frowned upon the old craft because of its intimate connection with paganism\u201d. The article says the craft is in \"danger of dying out completely\", however, due to an opening up of the country and devaluing of African art at home. The article then takes a patronizing turn. It states: \u201cThe old religious ideas are passing away and the African has not yet realized that his own art is a far more worthy decoration of his churches and other buildings that the tawdry imitations of European furniture which he buys. Forestry regulations are also said to have had an effect of discouraging the few carvers who might still have carried their trade\u201d. The article then discusses <a href='/collection/person/193'>Bamgboye</a>, who is said to be \"one of the best of the surviving Yoruba carvers\" and whose work is on exhibit at the Empire Exhibition. The article continues its patronizing stance, describing his carving as \u201cremarkable for its technical efficiency; in contrast with so much carelessly executed carpentry in modern Africa, his work stands out by its clean finish. A rasp is the favorite tool of the native carpenter; sandpaper and putty his indispensable materials. Bamgboye will have none of such things; a sharp adze, a sharp knife and a few chisels are his only tools\u201d. The article continues: \u201cOn the other hand, his art is strictly conventional. Like many other African carvers, he works to a formula. To carve a head is a matter of following certain rules; you begin in a certain way and proceed from cut to cut in a prescribed order; and the result is almost always the same, a face with an air of serene dignity but completely lacking in individuality. Bamgboye cannot carve a portrait. Even the decorative figures which he carves on stools and trays are conventionalized representations of cowries, birds\u2019 eyes, sandals and so on. He finds difficulty in breaking away from such stereotyped subjects to depict scenes from life on a panel. At the same time he enjoys such experiments and appreciates the results\u201d.

Two of the panels are illustrated on a larger scale below\".

Feats recounted include those of <a href='/collection/person/202'>Joseph Justus Scaliger</a>, who as a boy \u201clearned each day one hundred lines of Latin verse dictated to him, and later performed what is probably the most amazing memory feat of all time.

After the single hearing, he returned to his lodgings and wrote down the whole of the score of the composition from memory.\u201d  The clipping argues that: \"In these days of reference books and artificial memory aids, there is a tendency for the art and practice of memory to be neglected\", and thus for the faculty of memory to become \"atrophied in this restless age\".

There are two sections to the included excerpts, one titled \"Sudden Sight - and Sorrow\" and the other \"All Faces Look Alike\". The article opens by stating that \"A blind girl of 22, it has just been reported by a leading eye-specialist, has recovered her sight. She is only the fifth case recorded in modern times, and what makes her case interesting to many more than doctors is the fact that, having been educated in the world of night, she has suddenly had to adapt herself to the new world which her opened eyes are revealing. She had been fully educated as a blind girl, and was a good Braille scholar. She had learned to read through her finger tips, and had gained a wide knowledge of history, geography, music and arithmetic before she ever saw anything at all. The first things that she recognized were a nurse's white apron, and a red dress; and then a window and a door. As her eyes blinked at these familiar things one after another, her mind bit by bit groped its way until she was able to fit the visions to the descriptions she had read in Braille. General outlines came first, and it was only afterwards that she was able to fit in the details. Thus, she looked down and saw for the first time her hands and fingers, but not at once her nails. Although she was able after a little thought to say, 'That is a chair, and that is a table,' of course she had to be told the names of colours. Red came first, and next green. All her life she had felt her way successfully up and down stairs; but when eyesight was added to her, she began to stumble on stairs that were not there. When she trusted to groping hands she never bumped into a door. But at first when she guided herself by sight, unable to judge distances, she was always having little accidents.\" The article continues, saying that distinguishing shapes was a challenge, and that some things disappointed her, such as the animals at the zoo, which she had thought would be bigger. She also had difficulty distinguishing faces at first, and generally found faces to be less happy looking than she imagined. Some of these disappointments brought about an initial depression in her. The article excerpt ends by stating: \"that is the doctor's story of the first months after the restoration of her sight. Even now when she wants to feel really happy she sits down, closes her eyes, and read a book in Braille\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- the first several lines from the poem \"Song to the Wind\", which appears in the Book of <a href='/collection/person/273'>Taliesin</a>, reading: \"Discover thou what is/ The strong creature from before the flood,/ Without flesh, without bone,/ Without vein, without blood,/ Without head, without feet,/ It will neither be older nor younger/ Than at the beginning;/ For fear of a denial,/ There are no rude wants/ With creatures./ Great God! how the sea whitens/ When first it comes!/ Great are its gusts/ When it comes from the south;/ Great are its evaporations/ When it strikes on coasts./ It is in the field, it is in the wood,/ Without hand, and without foot,/ Without signs of old age,/ Though it be co-aeval/ With the five ages or periods\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- pink and blue ink spiral drawn on the scrapbook page by <a href='/collection/person/1'>Edwin Morgan</a></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph that appears to show light reflecting on water</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white image that is difficult to make out, but may be depicting water</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of two stone figures that appear to be sitting together in a vessel of some sort, possibly a boat</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a male sculpture standing with his arms extended out to the side and raised at his elbows</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a carved head, possibly a mask</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a clipping with two black and white photographs of stone relief sculptures, one a detailed dragon's head and one that appears to depict a mermaid on the bow of a boat, jointly captioned as: \"Examples of Makara and Khmer sculpture recently excavated and now included among the pieces for exhibition in the new galleries of the Mus\u00e9e Guinet, Paris\".</p>"}]}
