This is quite an elaborate ceremony, the pair circling each other in the water, swimming gracefully around and around. The wooing soon nears its climax and the male and female fishes approach one another. The female transfers her eggs into the pouch of the male, and they are believed to be fertilized at this time. They remain in the pouch for about forty-five days. Lower right is a male with a pouch swollen by prospective small seahorses. One can almost imagine an unhappy look on the paternal face. Above, on this page, the male fish bumps his distended pouch on a shell, possibly with a desire to hasten the day of the ejection of the little ones. Below, through the X-ray, we see the exterior and interior skeleton of the seahorse and the shadowy pouch, and, finally, a tiny new seahorse wriggling out of its father's pouch. The young are miniatures of the adults and soon are on their own, instinctively attaching themselves to something and starting to feed.

The first lines of the clipping read: \"The best portion of a hair to study is the middle third of its length; its characteristics are all fully formed, yet not frayed or mutilated through environmental wear. The parts of a hair are an outer cuticula, a wide cortex, and a narrow central medulla. The cuticle consists of great numbers of minute, structureless, transparent, imbricated scales, the apices pointing toward the tip of the hair; the overlapping of the scales reminds one of shingles on a roof or of scales on the body of a fish. As shown by the numerous studies of <a href='/collection/person/751'>Professor L. A. Hausman</a> , the size, pattern, and sculpturing of these scales is specific, identification of the species being generally possible from their inspection. This work has played an important role in detection of spurious fur garments. Bat hair is the most interesting of all types for its complex scales and has long been a favorite with the microscopist.\" The clipping continues, stating that the second most important part of the hair for identification is the medulla, although this feature is said not always to be present. The clipping then discusses the cortex and the ways in which pigment occurs in coloured hairs. The clipping states that pigment \u201cmay be diffused like a stain through the entire cortical substance, but is more often present in the form of definite pigment granules in either or both cortex and medulla. The cuticular scales are never coloured. The pattern of pigment granules is often diagnostic and an important aid in identification\u201d. The clipping concludes by stating that Hausman and others are now turning their attention to the fusus, which may be the \u201cmost important of all hair characteristics for personal identification from unknown samples. As the cells of the cortex grow and change from cuboidal to fusiform, intercellular spaces filled with tissue fluid are compressed along with the cells into minute fusiform areas. When the fluid has gone, these spaces, the fusi, become filled with air and will appear black under microscopic examination because of refraction of the transmitted light. Gray hair will result from loss of pigment granules with advancing age, but white hair requires, in addition, the presence of many fusi\u201d</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a clipping with two black and white photographs, one of a magnified hair and one of a magnified section of a human scalp.

Secondly, there is the inexpressible confirmation of meaning. Meaning is assured. Nothing can any longer be meaningless. The question about the meaning of life is no longer there. But were it there, it would not have to be answered. You do not know how to exhibit and define the meaning of life, you have no formula or picture for it, and yet it has more certitude for you than the perceptions of your senses. What does the revealed and concealed meaning purpose with us, desire with us? It does not wish to be explained (nor are we able to do that) but only to be done by us. Thirdly, this meaning is not that of 'another life', but that of this life of ours, not one of a world 'yonder' but that of this world of ours, and it desires its confirmation in this life and in relation with this world.

The clipping cites research by <a href='/collection/person/780'>S. A. Asdell</a> , in which three hundred intersexed animals were examined, all of which were hornless. Asdell argues that the goats started as female, but were modified in development by a recessive gene, or \u201cchemical hereditable matter, which causes hornlessness\". The article states that: \"Something of a similar nature is known in cattle. The so-called White Heifer disease is caused by a gene which is closely linked with white colour. Almost all cases of this disease occur in white animals, although of course the great majority of white animals are perfectly normal and only a few have the gene for the disease\". The clipping continues, stating that: \"'Freemartins' or intersexes in cattle are not caused by a gene, but by the transfusing of the blood of the male in utero to the female, changing its internal sex organs over to the male side\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a patch of snow on a rocky terrain.</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["153", "781", "782", "6"], "sources_ids": ["553", "554", "555", "593"], "people_roles": {"153": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "781": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "782": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "6": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 9, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["129"], "notes": "", "number": "811", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 4, "book_id": "4", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.40 Geography and oceanography; Mountains", "UKAT2.50 Hydrology; Water", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Flowers", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Insects", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Nature", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Trees", "UKAT3.20 Religion", "UKAT3.35 Languages; French (Language)", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Carving", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Drawing", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Painting", "UKAT4.45 Human settlements and land use; Landscape", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Aerial photographs", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Postcards", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men"], "keywords": ["Aerial", "Angel", "Art", "Carving", "Caterpillar", "Drawing", "Flowers", "French Language", "Insects", "Landscape", "Male Body", "Men", "Mountains", "Nature", "Nude", "Painting", "Postcard", "Religion", "Sunflower", "Trees", "Vase", "Water"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"painter": 2, "artist": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"Italian": 2, "Dutch": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Imaginary": 1}, "people_genders": {"Unknown": 1, "Male": 3}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "173", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page contains primarily black and white clippings, except for a large colour reproduction of van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers painting, which is pasted in the upper left corner of the page.

In the conditions of anaerobic fermentation there was not much fear of putrefaction of the meat, although what happened to it after it disappeared, leaving only the bone, is beyond my knowledge. I think you can take it that the practice is now practically unknown. What I was in France before the War - taking a party of cider makers round the wine districts - we were asked to sample the wines from two vats, one of which contained a wine of greatly superior quality to the other. On asking the purpose of this test, we were told that in the better vat of wine they had discovered the skeleton of a baby and it was surmised that in some way this was connected with the improvement in flavour.*'\".

It remains for the critic to say that they luckily had no effect on the performance of the work, which showed the East Grinstead at its versatile best\". The clipping continues, stating that: \"The death of <a href='/collection/person/785'>Bruno Xlavski</a> is a serious loss to music. Those of us who have watched his meteoric rise since he first discarded the triangle will feel an irreparable blow. It is a fitting comment on his genius to say that he piloted the Shostakovitch 129th masterfully, to his end. The last three hours of the work showed how brilliantly the orchestra can rise to an emergency\u201d. Other sections from the clipping read: \"Music has also lost by the death of <a href='/collection/person/787'>Smith</a> , the Croat whose work as a sound effectist has been noticeable in a number of modern orchestras. He was particularly effective on the air raid siren.\" Referring to the new symphony, the clipping states that: \"The composer - who saw in, by the way, from Leningrad, as he abominates the English spring and would not travel - has used his whole battery of technical resource. Twelve drummers and eight sound effects men made up a massive wall of orchestral sound, through which the 32 first violins succeeded in occasionally interpolating a line of pure if reluctant melody. The symphony is divided into 28 movements of which the last six are the longest. There are thematic associations between alternate third movements, with repercussions in the undertones. There is thus a haunting effect as of an idea being systematically followed by a diminishing echo, and the critical appreciation needs tuning up to it\". The clipping concludes under the subtitle \"Gas Jet Hiss\" and reads: \"All this will need sorting out by the various Shostakovitch societies all over the world, most of whom, we think, will find it hard to accept the master's early introduction of the idea of an escaping gas jet - a noise produced by the sound effectists with the utmost stealth. It was hissed by the audience. It plays a valuable part, however, in the overtones of the dominant introductory theme, and he would be a brave man indeed who would find fault. A memorable night.\"</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["806", "807", "808", "809", "743", "6"], "sources_ids": ["570", "571", "572", "573", "574", "595"], "people_roles": {"743": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "809": ["Depicted in clipping"], "808": ["Named in clipping"], "6": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "807": ["Named in clipping"], "806": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 8, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["678", "679", "3", "99", "672", "680", "681"], "notes": "", "number": "815", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 5, "book_id": "4", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.70 Biology; Death", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Flowers", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Horses", "UKAT2.85 Pathology; Blindness", "UKAT3.10 Cultural policy and planning; Statues", "UKAT3.20 Religion", "UKAT3.20 Religion; Church", "UKAT3.25 History", "UKAT3.25 History; Mythology", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Carving", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Painting", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Pottery", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Sculpture", "UKAT4.45 Human settlements and land use; Graves", "UKAT4.50 Buildings and the built environment; Tombs", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men"], "keywords": ["Animals", "Art", "Blind", "Carving", "Chalice", "Church", "Cup", "Death", "Faun", "Flowers", "Graves", "History", "Horse", "Men", "Mythical", "Painting", "Pottery", "Religion", "Sculpture", "Statue", "Themed Page", "Tombs"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"Earl of Leicester": 1, "2nd Earl of Pembroke": 1, "potter": 1, "painter": 1, "god of art, beauty, dance, flowers, song, fertility, agriculture": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"Franco-English": 1, "English": 2, "Dutch": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 6, "North America": 1}, "people_genders": {"Unknown": 1, "Male": 5}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"National Museum of Ireland": 1}, "sources_places": {}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "177", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page is comprised of black and white clippings, most of which are photographs of various art objects, including stone carvings from tombs in Westminster, a photograph of the Chalice of Ardagh, a photograph of a Posset Pot made by Toft, and a black and white reproduction of Bosch\u2019s The Blind Leading the Blind.

A woman and her two daughters, convicted of larceny, were taken to Maen Escop (the old Cornish name for Bishop's Rock, the well-known Atlantic lighthouse and the most westerly point of England) with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water, and there left to be drowned by the waves of the sea. Since the old name for Scilly was Sull-ey (Sun Island), it seems to me probable that human sacrifice to the sun may have been offered there; though I should not have thought it would be specifically to the setting sun, which would surely be seen to have gone even further west.\"</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["28", "41", "689", "817", "817", "818", "819", "820", "821", "6", "544", "956"], "sources_ids": ["583", "584", "585", "586", "587", "588"], "people_roles": {"28": ["Depicted in clipping"], "41": ["Depicted in clipping"], "818": ["Author/Writer"], "819": ["Translator"], "689": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "544": ["Depicted in clipping"], "6": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "956": ["Depicted in clipping"], "821": ["Named in clipping"], "820": ["Author/Writer"], "817": ["Illustrator/Artist", "Author/Writer"]}, "clippings": 15, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["688", "108", "687"], "notes": "", "number": "818", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 7, "book_id": "4", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animal welfare", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Badgers (mammal)", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Bulls", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Fish", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Insects", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Reptiles", "UKAT3.20 Religion", "UKAT3.25 History", "UKAT3.35 Languages; Dutch", "UKAT3.35 Languages; Middle English", "UKAT3.35 Languages; Russian (Language)", "UKAT3.40 Literature; Poetry", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Carving", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Drawing", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Painting", "UKAT3.55 Performing arts; Dance", "UKAT4.40 Family; Marriage", "UKAT4.45 Human settlements and land use; Landscape", "UKAT4.50 Buildings and the built environment; Crosses", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Alcoholic beverages", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Bread", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Butter", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Clothing", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Food", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Fruit", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Nuts", "UKAT6.60 Equipment and facilities; Clocks", "UKAT6.70 Finance and trade; Finance", "UKAT8.05 Historical events; Weddings", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Women", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men"], "keywords": ["Alcohol", "Animal Cruelty", "Animals", "Annunciation", "Ants", "Apple", "Art", "Badger", "Boa Constrictor", "Bread", "Bull", "Bull Fighting", "Butter", "Carving", "Clock", "Clothing", "Cross", "Dance", "Drawing", "Dutch Language", "Finances", "Fish", "Flea", "Food", "Fruit", "Gnat", "History", "Insects", "Ivory", "Landscape", "Marriage", "Men", "Middle English", "Nuts", "Painting", "Parachute", "Paratrooper", "Pear", "Poetry", "Religion", "Reptiles", "Russian Language", "Snake", "Typewritten Clipping", "Wedding", "Women"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"poet, playwrite, merchant": 1, "monk, poet": 1, "artist, wood engraver, writer": 1, "husband of Mary": 1, "Cistercian, writer": 1, "1st Duke of Buckingham, coutier, statesman, possible lover of King James I of England": 1, "saint": 1, "painter": 1, "Saint, Blessed Virgin": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"Irish": 1, "Flemish": 1, "French": 1, "English": 2, "Galilean Jewish": 2, "Italian": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 3}, "people_genders": {"Unknown": 1, "Male": 9, "Female": 1}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "180", "orientations": ["mixed"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page is comprised primarily of black and white clippings, except for one large colour reproduction of a c1570 painting once identified as Mary, Queen of Scots, but now listed as Unknown Woman.

It is a strange sight to see all the happy faces, all this gaiety against the macabre background. Then all these noisy ghosts, these demons of joy and madness, begin to move in long columns, they dash along in torrents, they turn and twist, sweeping backwards and forwards; the couples crowd together, surge on and back, without ceasing, never stopping, and the tocsin tolls, and the tum-tum of the drum rolls. The orchestra plays on, it hammers out the beat, growing louder and more insistent, and not allowing the dancers time to pause or to breathe; the volley of guns rings out at regular intervals; one hears cries, groans.

The article discusses organizations of beggars in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century London, in which there were different roles and types of beggars. The article names the men's roles as the Upright Man, who is the chief, the Ruffler, who is the Upright Man's second, Anglers, who fished through windows for sheets, Fraters, who were bogus hospital collectors, Priggers and Prancers, who stole horses, Counterfeit Cranks, who were fake epileptics, The Drummer, who doubled his tongue to make noise instead of speech, Tom of Bedlam or Abraham Man, who pretended to be mad, Jackman, who forged licenses to beg, and the Glymmer, who carried a license that said his house had been burnt down. Women to whom the Upright Man exercised \"some sort of seignorial claim\" are said to have various names, with Dells denoting virgins, Doxies denoting those who were not virgins, but were unmarried, Antem Morts denoting those who were married, and Walking Morts denoting those who were unmarried but had children. The children of Walking Morts were called Lullaby-Cheats. Thieving roles for women are listed as Bawdy-Baskets, \"who peddled haberdashery from house to house, bought coneyskins, and stole what they could\" and Kinchin Morts, who carried young babies and pricked them to make them cry in order to collect alms. The article states that both men and women could specialize in clymes, or fake sores, and reports that in \"the year 1600 there were supposed to be 12,000 beggars in London alone\". The suburbs of London are described as \u201cthe 'dark dennes'\" and \"worst places in England for beggars\". The clipping concludes by stating that: \"in the seventeenth century the beggar bands were broken up. Rogues were hauled in, branded with an R, and sent to Virginia. It was no longer safe to move in bands, the day of the individual had returned. Some of the ex-members became highwaymen, some Coney Catchers, or confidencemen. There were various forms of this. The Courtesy Man persuaded people to play cards with strangers: the Foist held his victim in charming conversation while removing his purse. He had to possess 'an eagle's eye, a lady's hand, and a lion's heart.' The Nip cut purses and let the coins drop into his hand. There were academies for Nips, where the little lads practised on figures hung with bells\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- on the back of the fold of the beggar clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a black and white reproduction of a painted (or perhaps drawn) profile portrait of a man. The man is shown from the shoulders up and appears to be wearing a wig that has been tied back in a ponytail.

They were a kind called Bobhowlers, and were about as large as sparrows, we usually found them in the boat house and this was the first time we had seen any dead so we held them near the candle to examine them better. Then to our horror they began to come alive, first their horried little trunks unfurled, gradualy [sic] their eyes all lit up and became bright red all glowing, then their furry bodies started to twitch and their wings to shiver but they never became completely alive, not alive enough to walk or fly, the glowing ruby eyes was the worst part of it. We hated them so much but something unhealthy compelled us to spend most of the night reserecting [sic] these dead moths, we felt kind of powerful, like God, but it was disipointing [sic] that as soon as we took them away from the candles [sic] rays they collapsed again. Eventually we went to bed and the next morning I just sicked and sicked till I'd got all the horror out of me, but Nan didn't\".

The clippings state that: \"It was not uncommon for Gypsy women, especially if they were elderly, to be buried alive. But death by hanging, even death by live burial, it was realised by the Germans, was altogether too quick and painless. By a Frankfort-on-Maine decree of 1722, it was enacted that all Gypsies were to leave the Upper Rhine area (as similar decrees were already in force throughout the German states, these people had nowhere to go), that all Gypsies found in the area after a short time were to be branded with the letters O.C., and then to be scourged, both punishments to be inflicted in public. If after this they were found again, they were to be executed either by hanging or by beheading. But if any crime other than that of being a Gypsy could be brought against them, they were first to be pinched with red-hot tongs and then broken alive on the wheel. No distinction was made between the sexes so far as these punishments were concerned, save that it was recommended that the women be more severely dealt with. A Neuburg decree of 1766 ordered that all Gypsies were to be arrested and tortured. They were, if no crime could be brought against them, to be beaten with rods and branded upon the back with a gallows, male and female alike; if a crime could be proved against them, they were to be executed. Branded Gypsies, if arrested, were to be hanged without further trial in the public street. The Neuburg decree also provided for the punishment of gorgios found associating with or helping the Gypsies. Between the years of 1700 and 1800, no fewer than 76 decrees of this sort were passed in Germany. It is not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that we find any sort of protest against these barbarities being made by a German. Then we do find one writer going to great lengths to justify them, while another admits he cannot think without discomfort of an 'old, helpless, perhaps quite innocent' Gypsy woman who had been buried alive\".</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["881", "882", "28"], "sources_ids": ["863", "864", "865"], "people_roles": {"882": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "881": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "28": ["Depicted in clipping"]}, "clippings": 8, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["99", "726"], "notes": "", "number": "838", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 3, "book_id": "4", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.50 Hydrology; Water", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Fish", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Marine animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Nature", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Sheep", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Trees", "UKAT3.20 Religion", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Carving", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Drawing", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Painting", "UKAT3.65 Leisure; Bowling", "UKAT3.65 Leisure; Sport", "UKAT4.45 Human settlements and land use; Landscape", "UKAT4.50 Buildings and the built environment; Castles", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Books", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Trading cards", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Engravings", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Women", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men "], "keywords": ["Animals", "Art", "Books", "Bowling", "Carving", "Castle", "Caterpillar", "Cigarette Card", "Drawing", "Engraving", "Fish", "Grey Gurnard", "Illuminated Text", "Landscape", "Lump Sucker", "Luna Moth Caterpillar", "Men", "Nature", "Ninepin", "Painting", "Religion", "Sheep", "Sports", "Trees", "Water", "Women"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"painter": 1, "engraver, natural historian": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"Galilean Jewish": 1, "English": 1, "Dutch": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 2}, "people_genders": {"Male": 3}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"Trinity College Library": 1}, "sources_places": {}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "200", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page is comprised primarily of black and white clippings, except for one small colour drawing of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, and a colour reproduction of De Hooch's painting A Game of Ninepins, which are both in the upper left corner of the page.

The letter is addressed: \"To <a href='/collection/person/885'>John W. Young</a>, President of Federal Laboratories\". It reads: \"'My dear John, Since writing you last we have been in our Indian station in Agato, Otavalo. We had a week of joyful simple life. Our visit was a blessing to us and we have reason to believe that it was also a blessing to <a href='/collection/person/886'>Miss Brown</a> and <a href='/collection/person/887'>Miss Robel</a> , the two brave girls stationed here. Six or eight Indians showed a desire to follow the Lord and we prayed with them. Some of them had made previous beginnings but had been pulled down by sin. Indian work needs a great deal of prayer. 'Yesterday I saw the Minister of War again and made arrangements to demonstrate to-day. The Minister, two generals, the head of the Police of Quito and a number of officers and soldiers were present. I used the 'Billy' first but I am sorry to say it did not prove a success. I shot it at two soldiers but they were able to stand the gas and get me. I then shot the grenade in a room and asked the men to go in. This was a real success and helped to gain what I had lost through the failure of the 'Billy'. '<a href='/collection/person/888'>Colonel Santor</a> happened to be here on a visit and he witnessed the demonstration. I found out through his conversation with the Minister that he, it seemed, secured some gas grenades (larger than yours and black) through the American brewer, Yoder. This is no doubt the reason he has been putting me off. It is more than likely that he got something out of it. 'Before leaving, the Minister asked me to give him the best price on 100 'Billies' and 200 grenades. I told him I would write to you and have you send him quotations and terms direct . . . . 'I have a letter from the Reed boys telling me that they are getting in touch with you. It may be best to have them as your agents from now on but I don't think they should come in for any of this order, as I . . .' The remainder of this letter is missing-the portion above was used as evidence during an investigation into the private-trade in arms held by the Nye Committee in Washington during 1934 and 1935. Mr. Young's company sold explosives and gas to the South American republics\".</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["889", "41", "28", "96", "776", "1"], "sources_ids": ["544", "876", "877", "878", "879", "880"], "people_roles": {"776": ["Author/Writer"], "889": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "28": ["Depicted in clipping"], "41": ["Depicted in clipping"], "1": ["Illustrator/Artist"], "96": ["Illustrator/Artist"]}, "clippings": 11, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["732", "733", "734", "735"], "notes": "blue ink spiral", "number": "841", "orig_material": "Y", "clippings_w_metadata": 7, "book_id": "4", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.05 Scientific approach; Research work", "UKAT2.45 Meteorology; Snow", "UKAT2.50 Hydrology; Water", "UKAT2.65 Natural resources; Animal migration", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Birds", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Dogs", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Fish", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Marine animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Nature", "UKAT3.10 Cultural policy and planning; Statues", "UKAT3.15 Philosophy and ethics; Philosophy", "UKAT3.20 Religion", "UKAT3.20 Religion; Church", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Architecture", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Carving", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Painting", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Sculpture", "UKAT3.65 Leisure; Hunting", "UKAT4.40 Family; Parents", "UKAT5.15 Information management; Metadata", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Trading cards", "UKAT5.30 Information sources; Postcards", "UKAT4.50 Buildings and the built environment; Doors", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Women", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Children (age group)", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men "], "keywords": ["Animals", "Architecture", "Art", "Birds", "Canada Goose", "Carving", "Children", "Church", "Cigarette Card", "Collage", "Dog", "Dogsled", "Door", "Fish", "Hake", "Hummingbird", "Hunting", "Male Body", "Men", "Metadata", "Migration", "Nature", "Painting", "Parent", "Philosophy", "Postcard", "Religion", "Research", "Sculpture", "Snow", "Statue", "Water", "Women"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"architect, sculptor": 1, "Saint, Blessed Virgin": 1, "artist": 1, "philosopher": 1, "Dr., Poet Makar": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"German": 1, "Galilean Jewish": 2, "Austrian-Israeli": 1, "Italian": 1, "Scottish": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 4}, "people_genders": {"Male": 5, "Female": 1}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {"Rochester Cathedral": 1}, "sources_places": {"New York": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "203", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page is comprised primarily of black and white clippings, except one small colour drawing of a fish, likely from a cigarette card, pasted near the center of the page.
