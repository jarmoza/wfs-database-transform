First of the H-bomb explosions, it was over 100 times more powerful than the A-Bomb set off in the Marshall Islands the year before, and 250 times more powerful than the A-bomb that killed some 80,000 human beings in Hiroshima, Aug. 5, 1945, and leveled an area larger than that of Newport News, Va. Since the 1952 bomb, two other American H-bombs have been tested, on March 1 and March 26 of this year. The force of the March 1 blast equaled that of 12 to 14 million tons of TNT. Some time this month the U.S. will set off another hydrogen blast.

Below the photograph is a write-up, stating: \u201cA series of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in March and April inaugurated the organ, above, which now occupies the whole of the rear wall of the auditorium and completes the scheme of interior decoration. The screen which had previously closed off the organ chamber has been made to fold back, exposing to view the whole depth of the chamber. It is a bold innovation on the part of the LCC architects, since organs are usually concealed either behind a grille or behind an arrangement of dummy pipes. In the Festival Hall only the graduated rows of pipes in the centre front are dummies. They are designed to give coherence to the informal groups of real pipes which can be seen receding in depth behind, and are arranged according to musical requirements. Their sculptural effect is emphasized by the lighting, which throws the whole interior of the organ chamber into relief\u201d</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- the full text of <a href='/collection/person/317'>Marghanita Laski's</a> poem \"Apology for My TV\", which Morgan has annotated as being from 1954</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a short clipping quoting <a href='/collection/person/318'>Dr. Cook</a>, who states that \"the sparkling advertising signs and streetlamps of London make starlings more mature sexually than starlings living in the country\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- an original colour photograph of a naked man who is standing with one leg raised at the knee.

To bring out fine shading and gradations of colour by means of the thin silken threads is a very delicate art. In the finest fabrics, an area of eleven square centimeters may contain 140 warp threads, while the woof threads may number up to 360. In ancient times, artisans skilled in this sort of weaving used to take as long as a year or two to complete a piece of silk half a square metre in size.

Above the photographs is short writeup, which reads: \u201cMost of the work in atomic plants is done by machines so that men will not be exposed to deadly radiation. But to do certain delicate repair jobs in those zones where radioactive dust is the only danger, men have to walk right into badly contaminated rooms. Up to now they have had to wear bulky clothing which had to be buried after one use, made working awkward and gave only uncertain protection. Now a new airtight, paper-thin suit has been devised which gives more freedom to move about and more protection against plutonium dust. Designed by <a href='/collection/person/329'>Homer Moulthrop</a> of the Atomic Energy Commission-General Electric Hanford plutonium plant at Richmond, Washington, it is made of polyethylene plastic which keeps the deadly dust off the worker\u2019s skin and out of his lungs. With Moulthrop\u2019s new suit, which his friends call \u2018Homer\u2019s Hideous Hallucination\u2019, a technician simply dons ordinary coveralls, straps on a face mask through which he gets fresh air and crawls into the suit along its long tunnellike tail which opens into an adjoining room\u201d.

The earth being removed, they imagined, from its size, that it was a rock; but some characters perceived on a more close inspection, together with its shape and hollow sound, when struck, made them conclude it to be (what on opening it proved) a coffin. On removal of the lid they discovered the skeleton of a man of gigantic size, which, on the admission of the air, mouldered into dust. One entire tooth remained whole, which was two inches and a half long, and thick in proportion. The length of the coffin was eleven feet three inches, and depth three feet nine inches.

The article details the sentencing of <a href='/collection/person/297'>Lord Montagu</a>, <a href='/collection/person/298'>Peter Wildeblood</a>, and <a href='/collection/person/299'>Michael Pitt-Rivers</a>. All three men were found guilty on charges of \u201cindecency and unnatural offences\u201d. Montagu received a 12-month prison sentence, and Wildeblood and Pitt-Rivers both received 18-month prison sentences. The article reports that \u201cAll three accused were found guilty of the charge of conspiring together on diverse dates between July 1, 1952, and October 31, 1952, in the counties of Southampton, London, and elsewhere, to incite two airmen, <a href='/collection/person/303'>Reynolds</a> and <a href='/collection/person/304'>McNally</a> to commit unnatural offences and gross indecency with male persons. In accordance with <a href='/collection/person/351'>Ormerod's</a> direction, Lord Montague was found not guilty on two charges of attempting to commit an unnatural offence with Reynolds during August, 1952, in London, and on August 24, 1952, in the county of Southampton. The jury found him guilty of two charges of committing an act of gross indecency with Reynolds on those dates.\u201d The article also states that \u201cWildeblood was found guilty of committing unnatural offenses on three occasions with McNally\u201d, \u201cguilty of gross indecency with McNally\u201d, \u201cguilty of counselling and procuring Lord Montagu to commit an act of gross indecency with Reynolds and of inciting McNally to commit an act of gross indecency with himself\u201d. Pitt-Rivers was found \u201cguilty on one charge of committing an unnatural offence with Reynolds\u201d, of \"another charge of attempting to commit an unnatural offence with Reynolds\u201d, and of \u201ccounselling and procuring Wildeblood to commit an unnatural offence with McNally\u201d. The article also quotes the Judge\u2019s statements, including his address to the three men, wherein he said \u201cit is quite impossible for these offences to be passed over I am dealing with you in the most lenient way I possibly can do\u201d. In regard to Montagu\u2019s case, the Judge stated that \u201cthe evidence as to whether an attempted unnatural offence took place between Lord Montagu and Reynolds rested entirely on the evidence of Reynolds and the evidence did not go sufficiently far to warrant a verdict of guilty on those two charges.

The article contains Beesley\u2019s account of the sinking of the Titanic. He describes feeling a slight jar when the impact occurred, but that no alarm was raised at first. Only after the engines stopped did concern rise. Soon after, the lifeboats were lowered and women were put into the boats first. Beesley says that all of this occurred with \u201cno trace of disorder\u201d. When all the ladies on deck were in a boat, Beesley reports a half-full boat being opened to men, which he himself got on. He reports 60-70 people in his life boat. He also describes an incident wherein his boat was almost hit by another life boat being lowered off the side of the Titanic. By 2am, Beesley reports that the Titanic was sinking in earnest, \u201ctilted straight on end with the stern vertically upwards\u201d. When the last of the huge ship sunk beneath the waves, Beesley describes \u201cthe most appalling noise that human being ever heard\u2014the cries of hundreds of our fellow beings struggling in the icy water, crying for help with a cry that we knew could not be answered. We longed to return to pick up some of those who were swimming, but this would have meant the swamping of our boat and the loss of all of us\u201d Places named in the clippings: Queenstown, Southhampton, Dulwich College, Wirksworth Grammar School, Derby School, and Cambridge.</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a pink and blue ink doodle on the scrapbook page drawn by <a href='/collection/person/1'>Edwin Morgan</a></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a short clipping that appears to have a typo in the title.

The article is dated 20 June 1954 and focuses on the reception of a report by <a href='/collection/person/435'>Kinsey</a>, titled \"The Sexual Behaviour of the American Female\", in the Soviet Union. The article discusses an attack by <a href='/collection/person/437'>Leonov</a> on Kinsey's report and the ways in which sexual politics and family life are being framed, politicized, and discussed in the Soviet Union. Overall, Leonov frames Kinsey as \"an instrument in the campaign\" that Leonov says tries to \"make man into beast, to spread the law of the animal world over human society in order to pervert and falsify the laws of social development, to justify war, to justify the lack of rights and the poverty of the workers, to justify the law of 'might is right\u2019\". Leonov calls the book \"the most cheap kind of pornographic hash, clumsily disguised as science\" and states that \u201cIt is clear that pornography in itself fulfils a definite social demand. Eroticism and debauchery have always served reaction as a means of distracting people from the daily struggle\u201d, but, for Leanov, Kinsey\u2019s book is \u201cdesigned to debauch the American people in the interests of a predatory Government by persuading them of the legitimacy of giving way to all their animal impulses at all times\u201d. Crankshaw says that the Kremlin is \u201cconcerned with the growth of immorality in the Soviet Union\u201d under <a href='/collection/person/436'>Stalin</a> and Stalinism. The Kremlin has started publishing reports of crimes and their penalties, while also glorifying the \u201cideal of harmonious marriage and family life\u201d. Crankshaw observes that this glorification has been carried out without mention of Communism, and he blames the government, not the Soviet people, for the \u201cwave of cynical licentiousness which is now officially admitted\u201d. Crankshaw therefore suggests that \u201cby linking sexual licence, as reported by Dr. Kinsey, with the \u2019reactionary\u2019 policies of Washington and by seeking to demonstrate its politico-sociological foundations, the Kremlin is preparing to lift immorality into the political sphere so that it may be denounced as \u2018a remnant of the bourgeois capitalist mentality\u2019 and attacked and punished as such\u201d</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a clipping from Doubt magazine, which reads: \u201c<a href='/collection/person/431'>Dr. Jose M.

The clipping reads: In need of names to brighten its roster, Mexico\u2019s short-handed (membership barely 5,000) Communist Party offered a bittersweet welcome to a long-lost comrade, Painter Diego Rivera, 67. In 1929, Comrade Rivera was excommunicated because of his growing list of deviations. He had fallen into habits of firing off peppery pronunciamentos without first clearing them with the proper Red monitors. Confessed loose-lipped Rivera: \u2018I got kicked out for shooting off my mouth.\u2019 He later even gave haven in his home for two years to <a href='/collection/person/433'>Leon Trotsky</a>. Back in the fold again last week, Rivera was strangely mum. In tragic truth, he was tired, in bad health and grieving over the recent death of his wife\u201d.

On that day a man from a neighboruing town visited the Hiroshima Communications Hospital \u2018with the incredible story that Japan had the same mysterious weapon\u2019 and that a squadron of Japanese bombers had now used it on the mainland of America. The effect of this report is noted by <a href='/collection/person/434'>Dr. Hachiya</a> in his diary: At last Japan was retaliating!

The clipping reports that \u201cIn the past few months there have been over 50 articles in the central Press alone on youthful alcoholism and hooliganism, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Young Communist organ, sometimes running to three a week. It has all been on a high political level: indeed KP has twice had to rebuke a number of local youth papers for \u2018sensationalism\u2019\u2014for instance that in Orel which printed the photograph of a youth whose sole claim to fame was that he had travelled without a shirt on a bus, thus revealing \u2018the indecent inscription tattooed on his chest.\u2019 Drunkeness is condemned as a \u2018survival of capitalism\u2019\u2014though it is difficult to see how capitalism could have had much influence on, for instance, the \u2018thief and drunkard\u2019 aged 7 mentioned in a talk over Moscow Radio on August 24. Case after case of promising youth workers and schoolboys, most of them Komsomols, who fall into drink and hooliganism, might lead the reader to wonder where they get the liquor. Vodka is, after all, a state monopoly, both in its production and its sale. KP has been backing the local Komsomol in a feud with the state trade agencies in Rostov, but the only victory has been that a factory youth canteen now sells vodka out of the window only, which it claims to be outside the factory\u2019s jurisdiction. Meanwhile every soft drinks stand for streets around really sells vodka only. And there are similar reports from Moscow and elsewhere. Even in the schools themselves, the position is not good. For example, Izvestia early this year mentioned a school, considered one of the best in Khabarovsk, where violence and theft were \u2018systematic\u2019; one boy had been beaten to death, and another, aged 11, was under arrest for knifing a master while under the influence of drink. Technical schools for older boys are regularly denounced as haunts of hooliganism. KP of February 18, after a routine description of the boozing, thieving and beating up indulged in by the pupils of one of those who are out in town, describes the activities of those who stay in their hostel\u2014\u2018gambling or copying indecent verses into their albums.\u2019 At the Komsomol Congress in March, its Secretary, <a href='/collection/person/440'>Shelepin</a>, attacked the young stilyags, with tarzan haircuts and parrot-like dress who populate the streets of Moscow, Leningrad, Tiflis and other cities, neither working nor studying. The stilyags are in a different category from the ordinary hooligan\u2014they are the spoiled (and usually drunk) sons of rich and influential parents and have long been regularly attacked and caricatured. But only minor figures are pilloried personally, and then only in particularly outrageous cases. Effective condemnation of favouritism is not to be expected in a country where the notoriously stupid and unpleasant son of the Prime Minister became a Lieutenant-General of Aviation at the age of 29. Literaturnaya Gazeta of June 26 quotes a case of four youths aged 15-17 who were holding up passers-by with revolvers. It was not this which struck the paper as extraordinary so much as the fact that that, since one of the accused was the son of a police captain (and in fact used his father\u2019s police revolver for his crimes), not only were they not charged, but the sergeant who pulled them in was sentenced for unlawful arrest. It is not, indeed, only robbing and hooliganism which are dealt with. Trud, for instance, attacks the euphemistically named \u2018butterflies\u2019 who prowl the centre of Moscow at night for \u2018good times\u2019, men and money\u201d</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a large colour reproduction of <a href='/collection/person/438'>John Copley's</a> \"Boy with Squirrel\" painting</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a large black and white photograph of three boys lying on their stomachs on a beach.

The girl, <a href='/collection/person/471'>Miss Phyllis Piddington</a>, of London, said that when Williams called at the house at which she was staying in Dogmersfield, he looked ill.  Williams said he had colic and that he should have weights placed on his stomach. He usually had some one stand on him. \u2018I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u2019 said Miss Piddington. \u2018He lay on the floor and I stood on his stomach for about a minute. It seemed longer. He said I was not heavy enough. When I told him there was a large man next door he said a woman would be better. So I fetched a woman from next door and we both stood on his stomach. After we had stood on his stomach two or three times he said he felt better and went away.\u2019 A detective constable said there had been a number of complaints from women about a man who had asked them to stand on his stomach. Williams, who admitted he was the man, said that he asked the women to stand on his stomach because he was interested in weight-lifting. He also said he had had a serious accident on a motor bicycle and felt he was not responsible for his actions.

Ses paroles \u00e0 l\u2019emporte-pi\u00e8ce d\u00e9passent souvent ce qu\u2019il veut dire : or il est rare qu\u2019en y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant le lendemain on n\u2019en prenne pas le\u00e7on et que sa clairvoyance pleine de gr\u00e2ce et de duret\u00e9 ne nous enseigne notre propre contr\u00f4le. Au reste, il aime les formules. J\u2019avais dit qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9 la vie \u00e0 ses colombes de terre-cuite en leur tordant le cou. Il colportait cette boutade, car lui-m\u00eame formule continuellement. Il n\u2019est pas discours, il est formule. Jamais son lyrisme ne se r\u00e9pand, n\u2019est d\u2019ordre torrentiel.
