The motoring party were accompanied by two young children, and while Lady Ballie was pointing out Glen Urquhart Castle on the opposite side of the loch, one of the children asked if a black object in the water were a rock. The loch was calm and the sunshine was strong. Ultimately the object began to move and rushed through the water at a high speed, leaving a long white wash. The party left the car and made for the side of the loch to get a closer view. The wash increased and then the object disappeared. The party, Lady Maud said, were delighted to have evidence that there was a monster in the loch.

The clipping discusses an amateur scientist named <a href='/collection/person/531'>Andrew Crosse</a>, who \"dropped a lump of lava from Vesuvius into a solution of hydrochloric acid and silicate of potash which he electrified from a battery with the idea of making crystals of silica.\" Two weeks later, \"white nipples showed up on the lava,\" and in four days, these grew legs and emerged as small white spiders, unlike any known species. Crosse is quoted as saying he was \u201cnot a little surprised\u201d, and states that \u201cthese spider-like creatures kept alive in the solution and still kept alive when they were taken out of it, but died as soon as they were thrust back into it\u201d. Crosse kept some spiders under a glass case, and these are said to have lived \u201ctill the first frost which immediately killed them off\u201d. In total, the article estimates there were a hundred of the small spiders, which ranged in size, including some so small you needed a microscope to see them. The smaller spiders are said to have had six legs, while the larger ones had eight. Crosse's experiment caused controversy and he was accused by some of being in \"league with the devil\". The experiment has never been successfully repeated, but <a href='/collection/person/532'>Michael Faraday</a> of the Royal Society inspected the insects and confirmed the truth of the story. Faraday offered the theory that the insects \"had been fossilized in the stone and were revived by the current in the solution\u201d. The article also offers another theory in which the creatures are thought to have \u201chatched out of eggs by the electric force that acted on them like an incubator\". Crosse himself offers no theory, and the article says that when <a href='/collection/person/533'>Harriet Martineau</a> wrote to ask him about the incident, he replied \u201cI have never dreamed of any theory to account for the appearance (of the insects). It was a matter of chance. I was looking for crystals and these appeared instead\u201d. The clipping also includes two wood-block prints, one showing an array of scientific test tubes in front of a smoking volcano and one a decorative drawing of a crystal. Morgan has annotated this clipping with a suggestion for further reading, stating: \"see <a href='/collection/person/530'>R.T.

The clippings states that \"two appearances by the Loch Ness monster on successive evenings were reported\". The first sighting was by \"<a href='/collection/person/528'>Robert Burrell</a>, a fishing ghillie; <a href='/collection/person/529'>Roderick MacLean</a>, a hotel employee; and a London chauffeur who was driving American visitors on a Scottish tour.\" Burrell reports seeing what he thought was a log on the surface of the loch. When it was about 70 yards away, however, Burrell states that \u201cit moved off at a terrific speed in the centre of the loch and then submerged. It threw up a great wash and travelled a distance of about 500 yards in a few moments before disappearing\u201d. The second sighting was by \"an Army officer from Fort George,\" who claims to have seen the monster while fishing and to have watched it for \"almost 20 minutes\".</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a sepia-toned reproduction of a sketch captioned as: \"'Head of a Young Woman'; by <a href='/collection/person/524'>Hugo Van der Goes</a> (c. 1405-82).

The article discusses <a href='/collection/person/534'>Albert Einstein's</a> \"new cosmic theory\", which is \"a generalised theory of gravitation\" that \"attempts to interpret in one synthesis the known physical phenomena of the material world.\" The article states that the announcement of the theory was planned \"to coincide with the opening . . . of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\" It also says that Einstein himself has acknowledged that he has \"not yet found a practical way . . . to confront the results of the theory with experimental evidence.\" The article then considers how long it took for Einstein's theories of relativity and general relativity to find proof and discusses how this new theory seeks to address \"the resistance of electro-magnetism to explain itself in terms of the theory that successfully interpreted time, space, matter, energy, gravitation, and inertia.\" No comment was given by those at the American Association meeting, except to say that they would need \u201ca little time to look into it\u201d. In response, Cooke says that \u201cthe layman may get some idea of the length of this \u2018little time\u2019 if it is explained that whereas the equation e=mc2 produced the atomic bomb the new theory requires four equations to produce the Lord knows what\u201d. The publication date for Einstein\u2019s full text is said to be February and Cooke states that the questions Einstein says he has answered with this work are: \"Why are there only a few specific types of elementary particles that go to make up atoms? Why do all electrons and protons have the same charge? Why do bodies produce gravitational fields?\" Einstein is also said to be continuing on \"with his lifetime's ambition, which is to harmonise the quantum theory and the relativity theory.\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a newspaper clipping that reads: \"The Moscow Literary Gazette has condemned Russian parents who give their children such names as 'Electrification' and 'Cracking Combine.'

It may be advisable to stimulate the cortex with a gentle electrical current. Such stimulation is able to activate certain areas of the cortex. In different sensory areas it causes the individual to feel a tingling in hand or foot; or he may seem to see gross lights, hear simply sounds or smell crude odours. When an electrode is applied to the motor convolution in the central region of the cortex, movement results in the opposite arm or leg or face. The jaw may move up and down, the throat may swallow, the mouth may open while the patient vocalises in a long drawn out tone. Or the eyelids may open and the two eyes turn in unison as though looking upward or across to the opposite side. As far as the patient is concerned, these movements are irresistible. When the electrode is applied, for example, to the motor area of the right hemisphere, he cannot, by the exercise of his will, prevent his left hand from moving, but he can reach over with the other hand and thus hold the moving member still. When he does this, he doubtless makes use of the motor area in the cortex of the untouched hemisphere\".</p>"}, {"people_ids": ["566", "567", "568", "569", "570"], "sources_ids": ["365", "260", "706"], "people_roles": {"568": ["Named in clipping"], "569": ["Author/Writer"], "570": ["Depicted in clipping"], "566": ["Named in clipping"], "567": ["Named in clipping"]}, "clippings": 6, "suffix": "", "places_ids": ["174", "479", "26", "93", "480"], "notes": "", "number": "1499", "orig_material": "N", "clippings_w_metadata": 3, "book_id": "3", "ukat_keywords": ["UKAT2.05 Scientific approach; Research work", "UKAT2.40 Geography and oceanography; Mountains", "UKAT2.50 Hydrology; Water", "UKAT2.70 Biology; Death", "UKAT2.70 Biology; Head", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Animals", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Nature", "UKAT2.75 Natural sciences; Trees", "UKAT3.25 History", "UKAT3.25 History; Archaeology", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts", "UKAT3.50 Visual arts; Sculpture", "UKAT3.60 Museums", "UKAT3.60 Museums; Exhibitions", "UKAT5.15 Information management; Metadata", "UKAT6.55 Materials and products; Bronze", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Men", "UKAT8.15 People and roles; Women"], "keywords": ["Animals", "Archaeology", "Art", "Art Exhibit", "Bronze", "Celebrity", "Cigarettes", "Collage", "Death", "Fireworms", "Handwritten Clipping", "Heads", "History", "Mating", "Men", "Metadata", "Mountains", "Museums", "Nature", "Phosphorescence", "Research", "Sculpture", "Trees", "Water", "Women"], "stats": {"people_epithets": {"Oba Sir, KCMG, Ooni of If\u00e9": 1, "zoologist, invertebrate biologist, ecologist": 1, "ethnologist, archaeologist": 1, "Sir, actor, theatre director": 1, "MBE, painter, sculptor": 1}, "people_nationalities": {"German": 1, "Nigerian": 2, "American": 1, "English": 1}, "continent_counts": {"Europe": 1, "North America": 1, "Africa": 3}, "people_genders": {"Male": 5}, "source_dates": {}, "sources_rights_holders": {}, "sources_places": {"London": 1}, "place_counts_dict": {}, "people_dates_lived": {}}, "foldout": "N", "id": "119", "orientations": ["portrait"], "desc": "<p class=\"desc_paragraph\">This page features a large, full-page black and white clipping showing several photographs of the If\u00e9 heads.

Burton considers some of the many factors, including captivity, that can impact longevity and, in turn, our understanding of an animal's full potential longevity. However, he refutes claims such as \"the belief that the large tortoises live to 500 years of age\" and that Indian elephants and blue whales can live up to 200 years. The article concludes by stating that \"attention may be drawn to the obvious difficulties of obtaining reliable information on longevity in all but captive and domesticated animals. There is, however, one exception, namely, the fishes, for the scales of many species living in the temperate zones show rings of annual growth, as in cross-sections of the trunks of trees, and similar rings are found in the otoliths\". The article includes a sepia-toned photograph of several otoliths, with a caption reading: \"One of the few accurate means of determining the age of an animal: Otoliths (bony concretions in the inner ear) of the hake, with annual zones of growth clearly marked. In his article on this page, Dr. Burton reveals the difficulty of arriving at an accurate knowledge of the life-span of animals. Fishes, however, are among the few animals whose age can be read. This is done by means of the annual growth rings on the scales or otoliths, bony concretions which are found in the inner ear. Both of these are, however, unreliable after about nine years, as at this age the annual zones become narrower and difficult to define. Photograph courtesy of <a href='/collection/person/571'>Dr. C.

W. Earp</a> titled \u201cThe Photographic Work of Nadar with a Commentary by T. W. Earp\u201d. The clipping which discusses the life and work of  <a href='/collection/person/301'>Nadar</a> and reads: \"Nadar was the pseudonym of Gaspard F\u00e9lix Tournachon, artist, journalist, and aeronaut, but now best known as a pioneer of photography. He was born in 1820 in Paris, where his father was a publisher and printer, whose Royalist sympathies contributed to the failure of his business in a period that vibrated with revolution. He could no longer support his son as a medical student at Lyons, and Nadar, compelled to abandon his career, came to Paris, like one of his friend <a href='/collection/person/598'>Balzac\u2019s</a> heroes, in search of a fortune. He lived a penurious life in the Latin Quarter, and took part, on the Republican side, in the Revolution of 1848. He studied painting and tried to write novels, but for an immediate living turned out caricatures and humorous articles under the name of Nadar. His facility gained him a minor reputation without easing a recurrent financial stress. On one such occasion, a friend to whom he applied for a further loan refused cash assistance, but provided him instead with a second-hand camera. His days in the Latin Quarter stood him in especially good stead when he wanted sittings from celebrities in literature and arts. His expansive geniality helped him with the others. But outside his profession, Nadar was also a well-known figure of the boulevards as an intrepid aeronaut\u2014a hobby which did useful advertising for his camera. After successful ascents in smaller balloons, on which his photographic apparatus always accompanied him, he built \u2018The Giant.\u2019 This largest balloon of its day contained 6,000 cubic metres of gas, and on one ascent accommodated 45 artillerymen on its two decks. On account of his aerial adventures, <a href='/collection/person/599'>Jules Verne</a> used him as his model for the hero of A Journey to the Moon, and during the Siege of Paris he was made commander of a balloonists' company. The money he lost on balloons he could aways regain by photography. During the Paris Commune he was on the side of the insurgents, but escaped the repression that followed the triumph of the Versailles Government. He lived on until 1910, honoured as the survivor of a romantic past and as the chief sponser of the camera\u2019s coming-of-age\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- next to the Nadar article, and likely from the same Lilliput magazine, Morgan has included a clipping which reproduces four photographs by Nadar, each of them captioned.

He is looking towards the camera and is not smiling. The photograph is captioned as: \"MAN OF LETTERS.\u2014Nadar was intimate with many of the literary figures of nineteenth-century Paris.

On the left (southern) rim is Kilimanjaro's highest point, Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze (19,565 ft.). In the background, circled by clouds, can be seen the summit of Mount Meru (14,979 ft.), 45 miles to the west of Kilimanjaro.

The map is captioned as: \"A map showing the relationship of the mountain mass of Kilimanjaro to the railway and Mount Meru, with the route taken to Kibo Peak\".

Rebmann\u2019s descriptions are heavily colonial in tone and sentiment. The article segment also states that \"Kilimanjaro consists of two main peaks joined by a long saddle at an altitude of about 16,000 ft. The secondary peak, Mawenzi (17546 ft.), is an extinct volcano and geologically very much older and, consequently, more weathered than Kibo.

This clipping is from the same source as the Kibo Peak clippings on Page 1505. The photographs are captioned as: \"The fantastic 'waterfall' effect of a glacier on Kibo Peak - a result of ablation - with vertically laminated snow in the foreground. (Photograph: <a href='/collection/person/619'>E. Robson</a> .)\" and \"An eroded ice-cliff - an example of 'nieve penitente,' caused by vertical weathering. Such fantastic shapes are common on Kilimanjaro. (Photograph: E. Robson.)\". The article excerpt discusses the initial publications of <a href='/collection/person/616'>Rev. Johannes Rebmann's</a> reports on Kilimanjaro, and particularly his report, surprising to British individuals at the time, \"that mountains covered with perpetual snow could be found just under the Equator\". The article then discusses 1943 and 1945 expeditions to Kilimanjaro by <a href='/collection/person/620'>Lieut.-Commander P. C. Spink</a> \"to examine the curious structure of glaciers under the influence of an equatorial sun. Such glaciers present an interesting study for the glaciologist, since, unlike those of high latitudes, they are subjected to vertical sun-rays, resulting in a vertical type of weathering, with curious and almost freak effects. 'Nieve penitente' formations are common, a good example being seen in one of the photographs above, and another fascinating effect is the lamination of snow surfaces. In places, the latter assumes the form of thin sheets of snow, like the leaves of a book, about six inches apart, up to two feet high, and extremely fragile. It is thought that this effect is caused by the combined action of sun and wind upon the frozen mass of snowfield, the crystalline parts remaining erect in this strange fashion. The steady shrinkage of the ice area of Kibo is manifest on the outer glaciers. Ablation of the smooth, firm surfaces takes the form of huge horizontal and parallel ice-steps, and this erosion can be seen clearly.\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unidentified Clippings:</span></span></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a bulldog standing on its hind legs and looking over a wire fence</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a man in uniform on a large ship taken from below the level of the ship's deck</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a curved brick wall</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a man lying on his stomach while propped up on his elbows.

F. Barber</a>. The article opens with an anecdote about <a href='/collection/person/85'>Robert Louis Stevenson's</a> father, <a href='/collection/person/632'>Thomas Stevenson</a> , who set Robert to \"measure the height of waves on the sea and the strength of the wind, to check a simple rule about the growth of waves which the elder Stevenson had propounded\". The rest of the article goes on to discuss the study of waves by engineers and devised schemes to, for example, obtain \"power from breaking waves by guiding them to throw water into a lagoon some 10 or 15 ft. above sea-level, electrical power being generated where the enclosed water runs off through turbines\". The article continues by discussing the increasingly scientific study of waves, measuring, for example, the great distances they can travel once generated by a storm. Research by the Admiralty focuses on \"being able to forecast those times when the surf will be low enough to permit sea-going ships to be laden by small shore craft\". The article states that: \"At the Admiralty wave-recording station in Perranporth, Cornwall, are various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\", which can act as a warning for incoming danger. The article also states that: \"the most satisfactory prediction of waves and swell is based on a detailed knowledge of the storms that produce it. The wind systems over all the North Atlantic Ocean are summarised in charts issued every six hours by the Air Ministry and by the Admiralty, showing the 'fronts' or boundaries of the circulating masses of cold and warmer air which make up storms, contours of the areas of high and low barometric pressure and a large number of measurements of wind. Ships of all nationalities make these observations while on voyage and report them by wireless\". There are special ships at six positions in the North Atlantic used for monitoring weather and waves. The article reports that: \"It is curious to note that fish by their behaviour can indicate the presence of a distant storm even before the ground swell reaches them\", demonstrated, for example, by the fact that cod and haddock will avoid certain eating or resting grounds that prove to be later affected by a storm. The article includes a black and white photograph of waves breaking on a beach, captioned as: \"Swell from a mid-Atlantic storm arriving at Perranporth, North Cornwall, where the Admiralty wave-recording station has various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval\". An abstract for the article is also included below the picture, which reads: \"In the 'World of Science' article on this page, Mr. N. F. Barber discusses some of the aspects of research into the movement of waves and the effect of storms on the surf which beats upon beaches some thousands of miles from the centre of the disturbance.

The clipping reports on \"The hundredth anniversary meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which had just ended in Washington\" and which reportedly \"found itself dogged and finally cornered by an old clich\u00e9 that subtle men have spurned ever since <a href='/collection/person/636'>Samuel Butler</a> gave it popular expression\", namely, the warning that \"man is too clever for his own good, that he suffers from the moral indigestion of his own discoveries\". The article continues, stating that man is a \"paranoid Prometheus whose cunning and strength have been exclusively devoted to releasing the forces of his own damnation\". The article considers presentations across a range of subjects taken up at the meeting. The article's first section heading is \"Mastery of Nature\", in which Cooke discusses a trend away from \"enchantment with the mechanical world\" into \"skepticism about the world of super-explosive energy\", or what he calls a \u201cDisappointment in <a href='/collection/person/637'>Sir Isaac Newton</a> . The section discusses issues such as \"Mesons, alpha particles, heavy water, isotopes, genes and hormones, the control of communicable diseases\". Other headings include \"Without Boundaries\", which discusses both the unifying force of science, and the fact that humans are surpassing their resources for the fulfillment of basic needs, and \"'Menaces' to Survival\", which discusses the \"two 'menaces' to mankind's survival\" as being \"the modern conquest of disease and the plans to redistribute industrial populations without regard to their population potential\". Also critiqued here is home industry and the gap between \"useful findings and their general application\" in the building of homes. Another heading, \"Atomic Space Ships\", discusses \"space ships propelled outside the pull of gravity by atomic energy\", although the problem of waste heat currently impedes that plan, and warnings from the United States Atomic Energy Commission that \"if atomic scientists continue to be made the butts of 'un-American smears' the United States might find itself without enough of them to keep its lead in essential atomic research and in the further refinement and stockpiling of the atom bomb\". Finally, under the heading \"Politicians' Maturity\", <a href='/collection/person/647'>Dr. Carl Sulzberger's</a> critique of diplomats in his address to the UN is reported, which took place on the same day as the Association's meeting. Sulzberger is quoted as describing the diplomats as \"a group of children, aged about three and four, trying to break one another's toys or squabbling to get closer to the ice-cream dish without a thought of one another\". This section concludes with a quotation from <a href='/collection/person/428'>Dr. Sigmund Freud</a>, which reads: \"The internal-combustion engine utilises, I believe, about 19 per cent of its available energy. The human being utilises rather less, if by energy is understood the ability to do all the work he is healthily able, to love and be loved effectively, and to work amiably and creatively with his fellow-men\".

Here we show remarkable examples recently secured at the White Sands rocket base headquarters in New Mexico. At the top and bottom of the page we show two mosaics - panoramas made by joining a series of exposures - the upper taken from a German V 2 rocket at a height of approximately 60 miles; and the lower from a U.S. Aerobee rocket at 57 miles. The large picture in the center is an enlarged section from the upper mosaic and gives some idea of the detail which can be secured. On comparison with the atlas, the upper mosaic is found to reveal the panorama (looking westward) of an arc which starts in Mexico, passes through Lordsburg and Albuquerque, and ends in the Sangre de Cristo Mts. The lower, a more vertical view, lies a little to the east and interestingly shows the launching site of the rocket and also that of the first atomic tests\". The photographs' captions read: \"The curve of the earth revealed in a mosaic of photographs taken from a V 2 rocket 60 miles up\", \"A detail from the Global Air Survey photograph above. This enlarged section is taken from round about the Figure (1), showing the Northern parts of Mexico and looking westward towards the Gulf of California\", and \"From Mexico to Wyoming in a single view: An aerial mosaic from an Aerobee rocket 57 miles up\". A numbered legend that corresponds to numbers superimposed onto the image provides a list of the places that can be seen in the aerial mosaic photograph.</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a text-based clipping that Morgan has pasted onto the large detail photograph of the earth from space in the clipping described above. The text clipping reads: \"'These religionists who believe in the second coming of the Lord - which direction is the Lord coming from?

Below the image is a write-up, which states that the caterpillar will become \"the beautiful Tiger Swallowtail butterfly, one of the commonest species of North America\". The caterpillar is described as being \"2 ins. long when fully grown, and greenish-yellow in colour. The 'eye' spots are yellow, edged with black, and the 'pupil' is blue with a black border. The true eyes are much lower down on the head, near the mouth-parts\". This colouring has been called a \u201c\u2019warning\u2019 colouration\u201d by <a href='/collection/person/577'>Dr. M. Burton</a> . The caterpillar also has \"a pair of bright-coloured fleshy 'horns' which can be projected from a slit in the dorsal wall of the prothorax. This slit can be seen in our photograph running across the base of the large upper 'lip'. The 'horns' are like the fingers of a glove, and are turned inside-out when in the body - the inner surface becoming the outer when the horns are projected. This outer surface gives off a highly disagreeable odour which has led to these caterpillars being called 'the polecats of the Insect World.'\" The caterpillar is said to eat \"birch, poplar, wild-cherry, fruit trees and many other trees and shrubs.\" The photograph is credited to the New York Zoological Society</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- onto the bottom of the caterpillar photograph in the clipping described above, Morgan has pasted a smaller photograph of the same caterpillar.

The article cites the research of <a href='/collection/person/732'>Mr. W. N. Kellogg</a> and <a href='/collection/person/733'>Mr. Robert Kohler</a> who \"conducted a series of experiments on this subject in a large tank at the Oceanographic Department of the University of Florida at Tallahassee. The tests were on bottle-nosed dolphins whose sound range rises from a low growl and groan-like sound to a shrill whistle which may rise to a frequency of several thousand cycles per second. These dolphins have highly developed acoustic receptor organs although they seem to be deficient in smell sense, which is surprising in creatures which obtain all their food under water.\" The experiments \"produced underwater sounds from an oscillator with a range of 20 to 200,000 cycles per second. The stimuli were in short bursts of about two or three seconds. High tones had the immediate effect of increasing the swimming speed of the creatures. Low tones disturbed them even more; they broke up their swimming formations, leapt out of the water, and at times seemed to charge the sound machine. From these experiments it is inferred that dolphins possess an upper limit of hearing much higher than that of man, perhaps reaching an upper threshold of 80,000 cycles per second\". The research also speculates that: \"The low frequencies may represent dangerous sounds such as ships' propellers or the noise of surf beating on the shore\"</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a man squatting down in an indoor space while playing a stringed instrument that is decorated with feathers</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a series of slats that may be from a window shutter or vent of some sort</p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"desc_paragraph\">- a black and white photograph of a man in dark underwear posing in a seated position.

We, or our successors, may in time learn more of this if the young golden eagles which are now being ringed in the eyrie are recovered in later years. When I was looking through an old newspaper-cutting book belonging to a friend, I came across a contemporary account of the shooting of a golden eagle. This bird was shot in France in the year 1845. It had a collar of gold round its neck, and on the collar the inscription was engraved: 'Caucasus patria, Fulgor nomen, <a href='/collection/person/741'>Badinski</a> dominus mihi est 1750. (Caucasus my country, Lighting my name, Badinski my master, 1750.)' The inference is that the eagle was used in falconry (as I believe it still is in the Caucasus) and may have been taken from the eyrie and trained for this purpose. But even if the collar had been placed round the bird's neck in the first year of its life, it still would have been ninety-five years old when shot in 1845. It had travelled far from its native land, but there was nothing in the newspaper report to show that it was old or failing in health\".</p>"}]}
